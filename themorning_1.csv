https://www.themorning.lk/articles/QpCFSVsKJGz6H26sRzQy,27 Sep 2023,HIP supplies over 80% of marine bunkers to SL market,"The Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG) has benchmarked a 500,000 tonne volume in their bunkering business during the first eight months of 2023. The throughput, which is five times in volume compared to 2022, is attributed to the port’s strategic partnership with Sinopec Fuel Oil Lanka Limited (SFOL), for the supply and trade of marine bunker fuel.“These numbers, which are proof that the port is moving towards the target status of an energy hub, were made possible owing to the aggressive, proactive measures taken by HIPG to invest in the refurbishment of our tank farm facilities and upgrading them to Lloyds Standard specifications. We have also introduced an independent ISO-certified oil testing laboratory facility at the tank farm premises for the convenience of our partners. This lab facility provides shipping lines with the critical advantage of obtaining oil quality reports on a real-time basis.”“The laboratory, run by Intertek UK is the only such facility available in Sri Lanka,” HIPG COO Tissa Wickremasinghe said.Through the offer of marine bunker fuel at competitive pricing to local bunker suppliers, HIP has facilitated the supply of over 80% of the marine bunker market in Sri Lanka this year. HIP’s overall oil and gas throughput to date was further complemented by the handling of 150,000 tonnes of liquified petroleum gas. The Hambantota Port and its partner Sinopec have worked together to uplift the marine bunker business based at the port since 2022. They introduced the supply of very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) to ocean-going vessels, for the first time in South Asia.  “This is a significant cost saving to shipping lines in terms of not having to deviate to another port, specifically for the purpose of obtaining marine bunkers. HIP’s bunkering facility has greatly benefitted Ro-Ro liners who can easily refuel during their normal port stay which helps them to increase vessel operational efficiency. Over two dozen Ro-Ro vessels have taken advantage of this new service provided by HIP.  The ability to service deep-sea fishing vessels with marine diesel to meet their needs on a real-time basis is another new dimension we bring to our bunkering business, as well as the highly competitive rates we offer. The port is well positioned on the global map as a reliable marine bunker supplier to vessels plying the main east-west shipping route,” the COO said.Over 110 international vessels, covering various categories including container, bulk cargo, tankers, and others, have refuelled at HIP this year, gradually positioning it as an energy supply hub along the Far-East to Europe shipping routes. HIPG CEO Johnson Liu said HIPG’s vision to establish the port as a regional energy hub will further strengthen its marine services such as ship lay-ups, ship repairs, ship handling, ship crew changes, and the provision of ship engineering stores facilitated through local third-party agencies. “I am confident all of these strategic endeavours will position the Hambantota International Port as a pre-eminent global maritime hub in the years to come,” he added.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/0k1UytbmmQIl9M4NZbdY,02 Jul 2023 | By Roshani Fernando,SLTDA concerned over pilot resignations,"Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Chairman Priantha Fernando has expressed concerns regarding the resignations of SriLankan Airlines pilots. He has accordingly notified the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL) that there are trained pilots with experience who could fill the vacancies. Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, he noted: “It may be necessary to consider recruiting pilots from outside Sri Lanka to address the impending shortage, as leaving aircraft grounded on the tarmac without pilots is not a viable option.”According to reports, 42 pilots of SriLankan Airlines submitted their resignation letters last week, while 85 pilots have requested certification letters from the CAASL. The crisis has been attributed to the relatively low pilot wages, currently set at $ 10,000 per month. With the airline employing approximately 240 pilots, the resignation of a significant number will have an adverse impact on the country’s tourism sector.SriLankan Airlines CEO Richard Nuttall acknowledged the airline’s struggle to retain talent, with technical staff and pilots being lured away by other carriers. To address this issue, the airline is planning to initiate cadet programmes and recruit expatriate pilots.However, Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva denied the existence of a pilot resignation crisis, attributing the decrease in the number of pilots to the reduced fleet size rather than a shortage. “When the airline had 26 aircraft, it employed 312 pilots, whereas with the current fleet of 16 aircraft there are 266 pilots,” he said.He also pointed out that around 150 pilots had already applied to join SriLankan Airlines, suggesting a potential inflow of new pilots.Regardless, it is essential to recognise that SriLankan Airlines is undergoing restructuring as a State-Owned Enterprise. The first step in this process, aimed at privatising numerous State-owned businesses including the airline, involves restructuring the company’s balance sheets. To facilitate this, the Government has established a State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit (SOERU) under the Ministry of Finance, which collaborates with international contractors.At a later stage, SriLankan Airlines will invite Expressions of Interest (EoIs) for its acquisition. Prospective buyers, including India’s Tata Group (owners of Air India), have shown interest in the matter. However, proceedings will need to await the restructuring of the company’s balance sheet. There persists a strong reluctance to take risks with tourism, given the significant investments made in promotional programmes across various countries. The President aims to attract high-end tourists and exceed $ 15 billion in tourist earnings. Notably, the country is currently experiencing a surge in tourist arrivals.According to SLTDA statistics, from January to May 2022, Sri Lanka received 378,521 tourists, while during the same period in 2023, the number increased to 524,486 tourists. Air travel remains the primary mode of transportation for tourists compared to sea travel. Finding solutions to the pilot shortage is crucial for SriLankan Airlines in order to ensure that all aircraft are operational and meet the increasing demand for air seat capacity in the country.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/ZA5Ki6f1D7Hy6bJqDpNe,10 Sep 2023 | By Dhananath Fernando,SL’s tariff regime,"The Minister of Finance mentioned that “many surprises” would be contained in the Annual Budget for 2024. In economics, surprises are something we would want to avoid; the more surprises we get, the lower stability is. Frequent surprises are a sure way to push away investors and the business community. One surprise measure mentioned recently in Parliament was a tax on primary dealers in the bond markets as they were left out in the Domestic Debt Restructuring (DDR) process. Just a few weeks ago, this column speculated about the likelihood of selective taxes, such as super gains tax or wealth tax, in the Annual Budget for 2024. If the reason to impose a special tax on primary dealers is the high profits they made as a result of being left out of the restructuring process, does this mean the Government is admitting it made a mistake by leaving them out of the debt restructuring processes? If so, we cannot correct it by imposing a tax, since two wrongs do not make a right.A special tax on selected groups or industries is the opposite of tax holidays. The way we select industries or business categories for special taxes is the same way we select industries for tax holidays. Both are two sides of the same coin. It is true that Government revenue is low compared to the size of our economy, but it is definitely not the fault of the businesses which made profits, unless their profits are exempted from taxes. Sri Lanka’s corporate tax of 30% is a reasonably high rate. Even the UK increased its corporate tax to 25% in 2023 from 19%. Tax competitiveness is already low due to unreasonably high taxes and an unstable economic and political environment. Therefore, what is the rationale for charging a higher tax on a selected industry or a group if they already pay a corporate tax of 30%? The unfortunate reality is that we cannot increase tax revenue simply by imposing selected taxes or by spontaneously increasing rates. This would bring the same consequences as our tariff structure. The issue with the tariff structure in Sri Lanka is that we have imposed different taxes for different HS codes, making it very complicated. Some HS codes are charged a CESS and others are charged para-tariffs, creating considerable doubt as to which taxes are applicable when importing anything. This complexity in the tariff structure has resulted in a high level of corruption. It is argued that bringing the tariff rates down and making it simple will improve tariff revenue. The same logic is applied for income tax and corporate taxes. The more complicated and more targeted special segments are, the more likely tax evasion is, and will eventually lead to our overall tax revenue further deteriorating. In 2015 and 2021, a similar attempt was made to impose a singular super gains tax on companies earning over Rs. 2 billion. There were many instances where special taxes were imposed on the financial sector without any detailed analysis or impact analysis on overall tax principles. Has it made our tax revenue better? The answer is an obvious no. Therefore, special taxes which may come as surprises for selected industries may not lead to the expected outcome. Instead, they will create more confusion in the market. It is likely that the Government is targeting primary dealers due to the controversy that arose during the bond scam in 2015 and similar incidents, with suspicions of insider trading taking place afterwards. If the reason for super profits is insider trading, the answer is a forensic audit and bringing the related parties to justice. The Government can start the process by releasing the full forensic audit report on the investigation of the presidential commission appointed for the bond scam.Imposing a special tax to correct the super profits of insider trading may start a vicious cycle of unethical trading and business operations.Investors will consider the occurrence of a similar circumstance if they make better profits – that they too will be liable for a special tax in addition to the corporate tax they pay. More importantly, it dilutes the principles of an aspirational society. Assuming that someone should pay a higher tax simply because they made a profit is discriminatory and acts as a disincentive for generating wealth and profit. Those who made a higher profit are already paying a higher tax proportionately, compared to those who made less profit, at a rate of 30%. Taxes have to be imposed based on principles of simplicity, transparency, neutrality, and stability. These are referred to as ‘principles’ because there is a rationale behind it. Statistics without principles and principles without statistics are both dangerous.

While the Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPLR) registered as at 30 September 2023 was 1,128 bps lower than the AWPLR reported as at 30 September 2022, the average AWPLR remained considerably higher throughout the current reporting period compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. Interest expense for the period under review grew at a faster pace than the interest income as a consequence of the numerous interest rate hikes, resulting in a marginal 0.3% reduction in Nett Interest Income. Net Interest Margin also recorded a decline of 47 basis points from 5.66% as at 31 December 2022 to 5.19% as at the reporting date, which is attributed primarily to the downward trend in the AWPLR from Q1 2023.Sampath Bank’s nett fee and commission income (NFCI) increased by 10.0% during the period under review compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. Growth experienced in the period was mainly on account of the increase in fee and commission income derived from card, trade, and electronic channels, as well as remittance-related activities.Sampath Bank posted a nett other operating loss of Rs. 2.3 billion in the first nine months of 2023 compared to a gain of Rs. 18.0 billion reported in the corresponding period of 2022, largely due to the Rs. 2.8 billion exchange loss stemming from appreciation of the LKR against the USD by 11.5%. This was however counterbalanced by the bank recording a nett trading gain of Rs. 1.7 billion for the first nine month period ending 30 September 2023, compared to a loss of Rs. 3.0 billion reported in the corresponding period of the previous year, which was mainly due to revaluation gains derived from its forward exchange contracts. The bank continued with its conservative and prudent provisioning policy and posted a total impairment charge of Rs. 14.4 billion for the period, though 70.4% less than the charge for the corresponding period in the previous year. The impairment charge for the current review period comprises Rs. 12.5 billion on account of loans and advances (corresponding period in 2022: Rs. 37.7 billion) and Rs. 1.8 billion on other financial instruments (corresponding period in 2022: Rs. 10.3 billion), as well as an additional impairment charge of Rs. 0.2 billion on commitments and contingencies (corresponding period in 2022: Rs. 0.8 billion).  Even though the impairment charge for loans and advances for the first nine months of 2023 decreased by 66.9% compared to the same period in the previous year, the total provision cover of the bank increased by 370 bps from 9.8% as at end September 2022 to 13.5% as at 30 September 2023.

I don't want to jinx it, but the road ahead is going to be harder,” Srinivasan said.He noted that there is still much more work to be done both in terms of fiscal policy and building reserves to become resilient.“So you have to keep pursuing those reforms both on the fiscal side and the structural reform side including governance and reducing corruption,” he added.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/BZJtTA8Fi5dn4AcsFbdo,22 Oct 2023 | By Tanya Shan,Debt restructuring journey and where we are now,"Sri Lanka’s financial journey from the brink of bankruptcy in April 2022 to its progress up to October 2023 has been a turbulent one, marked by critical developments. As the nation faced severe economic challenges and a potential default on its external debt, it embarked on a path of debt restructuring and negotiations that involved key stakeholders, both domestically and internationally.This week, The Sunday Morning Business will chronologically explore these developments, highlighting the challenges and milestones in Sri Lanka’s journey of debt restructuring and its current standing in October.The defaultIn April 2022, tainting its track record of maintaining an unblemished history of debt repayment, the Sri Lankan Government defaulted on its sovereign debt. This was a result of decades-long policy mismanagement and inconsistent policies. The advice provided by local economists to reach out to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) before hitting a potential debt default was not heeded and the failure eventually resulted in the country announcing the default. Entry of financial advisors In May 2022, Sri Lanka, facing a dire economic crisis and potential bankruptcy, enlisted the support of financial and legal advisory firms Lazard and Clifford Chance LLP. The decision, approved by the Cabinet at the behest of then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, came in response to critical shortages of essentials like food and fuel. These firms were recommended by a committee led by Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana and Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, with reported fees of around $ 5.6 million. First round of discussions with IndiaIn September 2022, India and Sri Lanka initiated their first-round of discussions aimed at restructuring the island nation’s official bilateral debt. These talks represented India’s commitment to assisting Sri Lanka in achieving a timely conclusion and approval of a suitable IMF programme. To secure the sustainability of Sri Lanka’s debt, financing assurances from creditors were essential. Discussions begin with international creditors In September 2022, Sri Lankan authorities initiated discussions with international creditors, marking the beginning of a debt restructuring process aimed at addressing the country’s most severe economic crisis in over seven decades. Staff-level agreement reached In September 2022, Sri Lanka and IMF staff achieved a staff-level agreement, outlining support for Sri Lanka’s economic policies. This agreement paved the way for a 48-month arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), totaling around $ 2.9 billion. The programme’s primary objectives were to restore macroeconomic stability, ensure debt sustainability, maintain financial stability, protect vulnerable segments of the population, and implement structural reforms to address corruption vulnerabilities while unlocking Sri Lanka’s growth potential.Discussions with China In October 2022, Sri Lanka started debt restructuring discussions with China, an important step toward finalising the IMF rescue of the island nation.President Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament that initial talks would continue after China’s Communist Party congress, which began in mid-October. Wickremesinghe also said that the Japanese Government had agreed to mediate the talks with China.Productive meeting with bilateral creditorsOn 3 November 2022, Sri Lanka reported a productive meeting with its bilateral creditors, including major players like India and China. The country was actively seeking to restructure its debt as it grappled with its most severe financial crisis in decades. This crisis was primarily driven by critically low foreign exchange reserves, leaving the nation’s 22 million residents struggling to cover the costs of essential imports, such as fuel, food, cooking gas, and medicine.India’s backing On 18 January 2023, India communicated its backing for Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring proposal. In a letter obtained by Reuters, Rajat Kumar Mishra, an official from the Indian Finance Ministry, affirmed their robust support for Sri Lanka’s forthcoming loan programme. India pledged its commitment to provide financial assistance and debt relief in line with the goal of restoring Sri Lanka’s public debt sustainability. Awaiting more assurancesOn 25 January 2023, during the initial monetary policy review press conference of the year, Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe revealed that the IMF was awaiting financial assurances akin to the commitment provided by the Government of India. These assurances were being sought from China and the Paris Club members, being a prerequisite for the progression of the agreed EFF for Sri Lanka.Dr. Weerasinghe explained that once China and the Paris Club delivered their assurance letters to the IMF, the fund would scrutinise these letters to ensure they met the necessary criteria before proceeding to the subsequent stages. Assurance from Paris ClubOn 7 February 2023, the Paris Club of creditors provided financial assurances to support the approval of an EFF for Sri Lanka by the IMF. This assurance was a critical step in securing the deal from the IMF, which was still pending Executive Board approval. Paris Club members, along with Hungary, Saudi Arabia, and India, expressed their commitment to collaborate with all bilateral creditors and key stakeholders to expedite a comparable debt restructuring process.Two private credit groups signal readinessAs of 5 March 2023, two private creditor groups had signalled their readiness to engage in negotiations for the restructuring of International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) held by Sri Lankan authorities. The Finance Ministry and the Central Bank were nearing the completion of discussions concerning debt treatment with bilateral creditors.It’s important to note that while the total Government external debt amounted to approximately $ 36.73 billion at the end of 2022, the focus at this time for the debt restructuring process pertained to bilateral debt as part of the effort to secure the EFF.Before this, a group of overseas private creditors announced their preparedness to engage in intricate debt restructuring discussions with Sri Lanka, aligning with the IMF programme, as confirmed by sources within the Finance Ministry. The total ISB debt, with arrears included, stood at $ 14.286 billion at the end of 2022, characterised by varying maturity periods and interest rates, according to the data from the ministry.IMF finalises bailout package On 7 March 2023, the IMF announced its intention to make a final decision regarding a $ 2.9 billion bailout for Sri Lanka. This decision came after China provided assurances that it would support Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring, effectively removing a significant hurdle for the approval of the bailout. The IMF Board was set to consider the loan on 20 March. This four-year deal between the fund and Sri Lanka was initially agreed upon in September. Debt restructuring discussions with Paris Club On 26 April 2023, President Ranil Wickremsinghe announced that Sri Lanka would engage in debt restructuring discussions with the Paris Club including India and separately with China. This initiative was part of an IMF-supported plan aimed at reducing and managing the country’s debt. By this time, India and the Paris Club had provided assurances for debt restructuring, while China had also offered its support to gain approval for the IMF programme. President Wickremsinghe explained that China anticipated separate discussions, initiating a debate in Parliament. Sri Lanka was simultaneously engaging with the Paris Club and India on one side and holding talks with China on the other.Green light for EFFIn March 2023, the IMF Board gave the green light to a 48-month extended arrangement under the EFF amounting to about $ 3 billion (SDR 2.286 billion) to bolster Sri Lanka’s economic policies and reforms. This programme aimed to achieve several key objectives, including restoring macroeconomic stability, ensuring debt sustainability, safeguarding financial stability, and implementing structural reforms to unleash Sri Lanka’s growth potential. Throughout the programme, a strong focus is to be maintained on protecting vulnerable segments of the population and enhancing governance.Initial proposal from private creditorsIn April 2023, sources with direct knowledge of the matter reported that a committee of Sri Lanka’s international private creditors had submitted its initial debt restructuring proposal to the country’s authorities concerning over $ 12 billion in outstanding bonds. This proposal represented the first formal engagement with the country’s authorities. Formation of creditor committeeOn 9 May 2023, 17 countries formed an official creditor committee, co-chaired by India, Japan, and France, to address Sri Lanka’s debt treatment request. This committee included Paris Club creditors and other official bilateral creditors. Sri Lankan authorities attended the meeting, reaffirming their commitment to transparency and comparability of treatment. The committee acknowledged the President of Sri Lanka’s commitment to fair treatment for all external creditors and the resolution passed by the Sri Lankan Parliament to implement the IMF-supported programme. The committee aimed to find a suitable solution for Sri Lanka’s external debt challenges, emphasising fair treatment for all creditors.  Recognition from Ad Hoc Group In June 2023, White & Case LLP conveyed that the Ad Hoc Group of Sri Lanka Bondholders had recognised the Sri Lankan authorities’ active involvement in discussions with their official creditors. This dialogue aimed to address the ongoing economic challenges and pave the way for the restoration of debt sustainability, according to the firm’s statement.Significant progress On 3 October 2023, a Reuters report highlighted “significant progress” in the debt restructuring cases of countries like Sri Lanka, Zambia, and Ghana. However, the report also underscored differences in opinions regarding the comparability of treatment with private lenders. In the case of Sri Lanka, approval for the fund-supported programme in March 2023 was made possible through financing assurances from an ad hoc committee of official creditors, co-chaired by France, Japan, and India and comprising members of the Paris Club and India.Subsequently, efforts continued towards reaching an agreement in principle with official creditors for specific restructuring terms. Additionally, the authorities had already restructured some domestic debt and were actively negotiating with Eurobond holders on a restructuring plan.Agreement with Exim BankOn 12 October 2023, Sri Lanka announced that it had reached an agreement with China’s Exim Bank on essential terms for debt restructuring. This development is a critical move towards accessing the second instalment of the $ 2.9 billion package from the IMF. The agreement pertains to $ 4.2 billion in outstanding debt and is considered a vital step in Sri Lanka’s path to economic recovery, providing the fiscal flexibility required to implement its economic reform agenda.Private creditors submit proposalOn 12 October 2023, reliable sources with direct knowledge of the matter revealed that Sri Lanka’s private creditors had submitted a proposal for the restructuring of $ 12 billion in foreign debt. This proposal includes the introduction of a novel bond type aimed at facilitating repayments in the event of future economic challenges. Acknowledgement of progress by Ad Hoc Group On 13 October 2023, the Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders of Sri Lanka acknowledged the progress made by Sri Lanka with its official sector creditors regarding a debt treatment framework within its IMF programme. The group, aligning with its earlier statement of financing assurances from 3 February 2023, and consistent with the goals of the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, remains committed to expediting efficient and equitable sovereign debt restructuring processes.The group, through its Steering Committee, has proactively submitted a restructuring proposal for Sri Lanka’s outstanding international bonds. This proposal includes upfront debt relief and introduces new securities, including a Macro-Linked Bond (MLB), which will be made available to existing bondholders. The group aims to work closely with Sri Lankan authorities to swiftly find a sustainable solution to address Sri Lanka’s debt challenges, particularly concerning its international bond debt.Current statusWith the restructuring process currently underway, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe told The Sunday Morning Business that the securing of the second tranche of the EFF with the IMF, which had hit a roadblock due to inadequate implementation of suggested policy measures and insufficient tax collection, would expedite the restructuring process. “Getting the second tranche approved will enhance the speed of arriving at a resolution with creditors. The agreement with the IMF will enhance the level of confidence of the creditors. Good progress has been made so far,” he said.

Perera last Thursday (10).During the press interview that was held at its head office premises, he made these remarks. He added: “When we compare this Rs. 5 billion with our total exposure, that is about Rs. 2, 300 billion.” He highlighted that therefore, this initiative could affect the bank in any such means. Responding to the inquiry raised by a journalist on whether its credit rating further went down, a BOC officer explained saying, “It is because of the significant uncertainty we had in the market. It (the rating) came down after the DDO announcement.”    From the aforesaid initiative, BOC is expected to empower the underprivileged segments in the country as livelihood development projects that provide inspiration and financial assistance for them to build their villages by themselves. Accordingly, this project has been rolled-out to over six selected villages in the rural outskirts of the country so far.Out of the Rs. 5 billion that has been allocated for this project, Rs. 4 billion is for the Micro, Small, and Medium Entrepreneurs (MSME) and the rest is for the start-up businesses, while the rate of interest for the loan begins at 12% p. a., depending  on the availability of a mortgage over property. They added: “We are targeting on granting fresh loans for feasible proposals that cover areas other than trading, renting, hiring, leasing, and consumption at an attractive rate and comes with other benefits. Therefore, entrepreneurs who are engaged in areas of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, industry based, service-oriented, and other similar sectors will be benefited through this programme.”The BOC Chair also noted that in order to encourage female participation in the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the programme was to support women-led businesses. Accordingly, Medirigiriya-Tissa Amuna, Mandaram Nuwara, Hunukotuwa, Mulative-Thirthkarai, Dehiowita-Meegasthena, Nawagthegma-Kuruketiyawa, and Ella-Maduragma areas will be subjected for the BOC Gammana development programme.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/VUDsygCwa1BY8JL6BrTu,30 Jul 2023 | By Madhusha Thavapalakumar,‘Finding balance in exchange rate management essential’  CCC Chairman Duminda Hulangamuwa,"In an exclusive interview with The Sunday Morning Business, newly-appointed Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) Duminda Hulangamuwa discusses the immediate priorities and long-term focuses in the journey towards Sri Lanka’s economic transformation and attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Shedding light on the ongoing reforms and the significance of the Domestic Debt Restructuring (DDR) programme, the Chairman highlights the challenges faced and outlines strategies to attract FDI, bolster the service sector, and increase exports.As the new Chairman of the CCC, what are your immediate priorities as well as short-, medium-, and long-term focuses?As the new Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, I am fully aware of the multitude of roles that the CCC plays in the context of today’s world. Our first and immediate priority is to adopt a country-first approach, wherein we aim to support the Government and businesses in stabilising in order to face the current challenges.Over the past year, we have actively taken on the role of supporting the reform process during the financial crisis. This involved collaborating with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to implement necessary reforms such as interest rate hikes, exchange rate adjustments, and rate restructuring. Our efforts have been geared towards controlling expenditure, increasing fiscal discipline, and ensuring financial stability.In the short term, we will continue to educate the public and engage with political parties to highlight the importance of ongoing reforms. A major focus area during this phase is the reform of electricity and fuel distribution, an essential component of the country’s economic development.Moreover, we are committed to working with the Government to improve policy certainty and political stability, which are crucial factors in attracting FDI. We firmly believe that once we achieve policy consistency and demonstrate our commitment to reform, Sri Lanka will be viewed as a sustainable country, thereby opening the doors to foreign investors.In the medium to long term, our primary objective is to put the country on a sustainable growth path. Economic stabilisation is necessary, but it is only the first step. To achieve sustained growth, we need to create better opportunities for our people, generate more employment, and increase the purchasing power and income of the population.To achieve these goals, our focus will be on attracting new investments. While Sri Lanka has its capital and market potential, this alone may not be sufficient to propel the desired growth rate of 5-6%. Therefore, we need to invite foreign capital to invest in our country. One of our key initiatives will be to develop Sri Lanka’s logistics and shipping hub concept, inviting large investments in the logistics sector.We are also looking to bolster the service sector, particularly the Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing (IT/BPO) industry. This industry has the potential to earn foreign currency and contribute significantly to the country’s economic growth.To increase exports, we need to address some challenges. While the private sector should be driven towards exports, we must also seek FDI to boost our export-oriented projects. We are actively working towards securing the India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement, which will enable us to attract foreign companies to invest in Sri Lanka and use it as a manufacturing base for exports.However, we are well aware that attracting significant investments and achieving sustainable growth will not happen overnight. We need to address several fundamental aspects, such as policy certainty, political stability, workforce development, and infrastructure enhancement to create an environment that will entice big investors.While these challenges may take time to overcome, we are determined to work with the Government and industry to facilitate the necessary changes. The CCC plays a vital role in helping the Government develop policy frameworks for macroeconomic development and engaging in various committees to provide valuable insights and ideas.We also prioritise our membership, as they face operational and strategic issues on a daily basis. Our involvement in resolving issues faced by industries like the poultry sector through policy advocacy and promoting consistency is an ongoing effort. We are also exploring avenues to improve agriculture by urging the Government to allocate land for corporate agriculture, enabling our members to scale up their operations and contribute to the country’s food security and economic growth.Can you shed some light on the potential for attracting FDI to Sri Lanka?Attracting FDI is crucial for Sri Lanka’s economic growth and development. However, it is essential to understand the level of FDI that we can realistically target at this moment. We need to identify our strengths and capitalise on them strategically. For instance, attempting to attract large manufacturing giants like Toyota, Nissan, or Sony to set up factories here may not be feasible due to the lack of critical resources such as land area, electricity, water, proper waste disposal systems, and a well-established road network.Instead, our approach should be to focus on what we are already proficient in, like manufacturing components or tools for these industries. By demonstrating our capability in producing the next layer of products or providing essential support services, we can build confidence among potential investors. For instance, showcasing our expertise in garment manufacturing has worked well for Sri Lanka.To be ready for FDI, we must assess our current capacity to handle investments. While we may not be prepared for billion-dollar projects in manufacturing, we can manage and handle investments in the range of $ 100-200 million. This is where we can currently attract investments. For Sri Lanka to be highly competitive in attracting a billion-dollar investments, we must leverage our infrastructure, especially in the logistics and shipping sector.Presenting ourselves as a shipping hub with well-developed logistics facilities can entice international companies to invest in infrastructure related to the shipping industry. Propelling growth in this area can be a significant game-changer for our economy. However, setting up large-scale car manufacturing or similar industries may not be practical at the moment, given our limitations.The Government and the Board of Investment (BOI) need to focus on what Sri Lanka can presently offer based on its available resources and labour force. Our competitive advantage lies in our infrastructure and we must optimise this advantage to attract higher investments. For instance, creating an environment with policy consistency and improved infrastructure will encourage foreign investors to consider Sri Lanka as a viable option for their business ventures.Addressing the challenges faced by our exporters is another important aspect. Currently, our exports are primarily reliant on Western markets, which are experiencing recession-like conditions, resulting in reduced purchasing power and demand for our products. To address this, the Government needs to actively support our exporters by facilitating trade fairs, investor forums, and providing export insurance schemes.However, it is crucial to understand that local exporters play a significant role in driving the export market. They need to invest in Research and Development (R&D), marketing, and quality assurance to compete effectively on the global stage. This process takes time and established exporters who already have tried and tested products are the ones most likely to venture into foreign markets successfully.In previous statements, you mentioned that the reforms Sri Lanka is going through are painful and affecting our everyday lifestyle. Can you elaborate on these challenges and how they contribute to the country’s transformation from a dependent to an independent nation?Indeed, the ongoing reforms have been quite challenging and costly, leading to significant impacts on our daily lives. One major issue has been the 86% increase in taxes, which has affected everyone’s income and savings. Additionally, rising petrol prices have driven up the cost of living, while electricity prices have also seen an increase. These changes have affected all citizens, making it a difficult period for the nation.However, it is crucial to understand the bigger picture and the need for these reforms. As a country, we cannot solely rely on handouts or subsidies; we must transform ourselves into a self-reliant, independent nation. Could you explain the DDR programme and its significance in stabilising the economy?The DDR programme aims to address the Government’s debt burden by seeking contributions from various entities owned by the Government. This includes superannuation funds, banks, and private lenders. While the programme is not an ideal situation for any party involved, it was essential to find a solution to the nation’s debt issue.The DDR programme has a broad and impartial approach, distributing the burden across various stakeholders to minimise the impact on any one group. It was a challenging decision, but it was necessary to show external creditors that we were taking significant steps to manage our debts effectively.There seems to be concern about the stability of commercial banks amidst the DDR programme. Can you provide insights into why the Government chose to leave the banks unaffected?Commercial banks play a crucial role in the country’s economic stability. They have been at the forefront of supporting the economy during difficult times, such as providing concessionary loans and moratoriums on collections. The potential risks associated with restructuring the banks could lead to a chain reaction of withdrawals, causing further damage to the economy.Leaving the banks unaffected in the DDR programme was justified considering the sensitivity of the issue and the potential repercussions. Furthermore, commercial banks have also contributed significantly to the Government’s revenue through taxes, making them a crucial pillar of the economy.While the DDR programme may be necessary, what are its potential effects on the country’s currency stability, given the recent easing of foreign exchange restrictions?Easing foreign exchange restrictions and the DDR programme may indeed put pressure on the country’s currency. However, it is essential to find the right balance between managing the exchange rate and allowing the economy to function smoothly. The market forces will ultimately determine the rupee’s value based on supply and demand dynamics.The gradual easing of restrictions is a step towards normalising the economy and supporting industries that depend on imports. It is essential to ensure the survival and growth of these industries while managing the currency’s stability. While there may be some pressure on the rupee, the Government’s approach seems to be heading in the right direction.Regarding State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) restructuring, there appear to be challenges in finding buyers for some of these institutions. How does the Government plan to address this situation, particularly with SriLankan Airlines?SOE restructuring is a complex process and finding buyers for some institutions could indeed pose challenges. Divesting Government assets requires a transparent and careful approach, considering the potential political and union-related ramifications. Currently, the Government has called for financial advice to assess the value of these enterprises and identify potential buyers.While the process may take time, there is optimism that buyers will come forward. However, the Government is committed to ensuring that any divestiture aligns with the best interests of the nation, and if the correct price is not achieved, it may reconsider the sale.

In fact, some projects require approvals from 70 institutions,” Amunugama highlighted.The State Minister made these remarks during a discussion held with BOI trade union representatives recently.“In this context, attention has been drawn to leveraging a business model called the plug-and-play model where all clearances and other prerequisites will be in place before the project is awarded to any investor. Here, the business firms are not required to focus on the basic requirements for setting up a business as everything is arranged by the relevant authority, which would be the BOI,” he explained.He stressed that the new powers would see investors being given more efficient clearance processes for relevant projects, offering investors additional certainty and clarity.“With the new powers in place, the BOI will be equipped to act more independently and effectively and thus, be upbeat about wooing more investors to Sri Lanka,” Amunugama added.Moreover, the State Minister pointed out: “In light of the present situation in the country, driving more investments and promoting tourism is the need of the hour. As such, the BOI needs to bend over backwards to make sure that investors feel comfortable and confident in doing business in Sri Lanka.”Meanwhile, Joint Trade Union Alliance Convenor Mahesh Abegunawardana opined: “The delays that are caused by the inefficiency of other institutions when granting approvals for projects are often considered delays of the BOI. This is evident with what transpired in the recently declared open Hanthana International Bird Park where the BOI was blamed for not granting approvals on time causing a major impediment; however, there were no delays from our end.”Abegunawardana added that the BOI employees are always geared to perform their duties with utmost capacity and commitment for the betterment of the institution and the country at large.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/1wYmp5zUlfib4t8BhSBN,23 Nov 2023 | BY Paul Carsten,Oil prices dip in pre-Thanksgiving trade ahead of OPEC+ cuts,"Oil prices slipped slightly on Wednesday in the quiet pre-U.S. Thanksgiving holiday trading, as the market awaited news on output cuts from the OPEC+ producers group and looked for confirmation of a sharp build-up in U.S. crude stocks.Brent crude futures fell 52 cents to $81.93 a barrel by 0946 GMT. U.S. West Texas intermediate crude futures were down 49 cents to $77.28.Both benchmarks have fallen for four straight weeks, and prices weakened further last week on growing concerns about the demand outlook.Investors remained cautious ahead of Sunday’s (25) scheduled OPEC+ meeting, when the producer group may discuss deepening supply cuts due to slowing global economic growth.On Monday (20), both contracts climbed about 2% after three OPEC+ sources told Reuters the group, the organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied producers, was set to consider more oil supply cuts when it meets on 25 November. “The upcoming meeting has been the key central focus for oil prices for now, with sentiments shrugging off the sharp build in U.S. crude inventories,” said Jun Rong Yeap, a market strategist at IG.OPEC+ is likely to extend or even deepen oil supply cuts into next year, analysts have predicted.Even if the OPEC+ nations extend their cuts into next year, the global oil market will see a slight supply surplus in 2024, the head of the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) oil markets and industry division said on Tuesday (21).To support prices, OPEC and its allies will need to not only extend, but increase cuts, said John Evans of oil broker PVM in a note on Wednesday (22).“A rollover of cuts and voluntary cuts will send the market south, for the current level of supply clamp is not enough to persuade the market that it is ‘tight’,” he said. “Oil is in for some tense and headline-reactive days.”U.S. crude stocks rose by nearly 9.1 million barrels in the week ended 17 November, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday (21).Gasoline inventories dropped by about 1.79 million barrels, while distillate inventories fell by about 3.5 million barrels.U.S. Government data on stockpiles is due on Wednesday.Thursday is a public holiday in the United States for Thanksgiving.(Reuters)

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/xTpXPzK3QNr8vB7flMkJ,01 Oct 2023 | By Tanya Shan,SIM card replication in Sri Lanka: Fact or fiction?,"The digital age has brought unparalleled connectivity and convenience, but it has also ushered in a new era of cyber threats and vulnerabilities. In Sri Lanka, persistent rumours of SIM card replication have caused serious concerns, leaving citizens in a state of anxiety and uncertainty. As these speculations continue to circulate, The Sunday Morning Business conducted a thorough investigation into the feasibility of such practices and to provide guidance on safeguarding one’s digital identity in an age of increasing cyber threats.Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, however, State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath unequivocally dismissed the possibility of SIM card replication. He asserted that the current measures enforced by telecommunication companies required rigorous identity verification when issuing SIM cards. “Right now, when a telecommunication company issues a SIM, they get all the details of the customer. If you are going to buy a SIM card, you have to produce your identity card number or passport number for them to be able to verify it.”Although The Sunday Morning Business also reached out to a few telecommunication company operators, none of them wished to be quoted on the matter. Unfounded and unlikely Telco insiders assert that rumours of SIM card replication are not only unfounded, but often perpetuated by sensationalist blogs and YouTube channels seeking views at the expense of factual accuracy. These experts maintain that the telecommunications infrastructure in Sri Lanka has evolved to incorporate robust security measures, making SIM card replication a highly unlikely occurrence.Telcos employ unique serial numbers, known as Mobile Equipment (ME), to identify SIM cards. Each physical SIM card possesses its own serial number, referred to as Mobile Card (MC). This dual identification system creates significant obstacles for any attempt at SIM card replication.Alternative theories However, it is worth exploring alternative theories. While replicating SIM cards may pose substantial challenges, there is a growing concern about social engineering tactics employed by cybercriminals. These tactics often involve deceiving individuals into disclosing their One-Time Passwords (OTPs) or installing third-party applications that clandestinely clone their messages. Such strategies bypass the need for SIM card replication, focusing instead on obtaining OTPs for illicit financial transactions.In Western nations, the ease of acquiring disposable ‘burner’ SIM cards and the accessibility of SIM transfer services through call centres have exposed vulnerabilities. Conversely, Sri Lanka’s stringent telco guidelines mandate in-person SIM card requests, theoretically acting as a deterrent against cybercriminal exploitation.Persistent complaints To gain deeper insights into the matter, The Sunday Morning Business reached out to Cyber Security Advisor Asela Waidyalankara, who has firsthand experience in cyber threats and digital security. Waidyalankara explained the presence of unique identifiers – the Mobile Equipment number and Mobile Card number – which are pivotal in distinguishing genuine SIM cards from counterfeit ones: “Just like your phone has a serial number, there is what is called the ME. Telcos have a way of identifying the physical SIM, called the MC.” Despite the presence of these identifiers, there have been persistent complaints, with individuals and organisations reporting cases of SIM replication. Waidyalankara shared his firsthand experience, stating: “I have received this complaint. I have people calling me and making this complaint, as well as certain organisations that have got in touch.”He suggested that there was some form of social engineering being carried out, shedding light on a sophisticated web of tactics employed by cybercriminals. He explained: “People are actually disclosing their OTPs to a third party. The moment your OTP is disclosed per transaction, then your financial information is at risk.”What becomes apparent is that the crux of this issue lies not merely in duplicating SIM cards but in manipulating individuals into revealing their OTPs. Waidyalankara stated: “I feel that something along these lines is happening, such as a person’s messages getting cloned through a third-party app, etc.” He offered a glimpse into the evolving strategies of cybercriminals, who might employ tactics such as impersonating influencers on social media platforms to extract OTPs from unsuspecting victims.How cybercriminals operate in SLHowever, Waidyalankara dispelled the notion of a straightforward SIM duplication process, emphasising that the matter was far more complex in Sri Lanka. He explained: “Unlike in Western countries where you can get burner SIMs, call the call centre, and do a SIM transfer, that is not allowed here.” This sheds light on the stringent regulations enforced by theTelecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL), which mandate customers to physically request and collect their SIM cards.How are cybercriminals circumventing these controls? This question looms large, hinting at the need for comprehensive cybersecurity measures and vigilant user behaviour. Waidyalankara explained: “First they capture the OTP. The moment they capture the OTP, the rest is then a matter of transferring money out of your account without your knowledge.”For example, John, a diligent bank customer, receives a phone call from an individual posing as a bank representative. Armed with convincing social engineering tactics, the imposter convinces John that his bank account has been compromised and requests the OTP sent to his phone for verification. Concerned, John inadvertently divulges the OTP, unwittingly granting the scammer access to his account.This alternative method could bypass the need for SIM card replication entirely. By manipulating individuals into revealing their OTPs, cybercriminals can sidestep the complexities of SIM cloning and gain direct access to financial accounts.Importance of digital literacy and collective efforts While the mystery of SIM card replication looms, Waidyalankara shifted the spotlight to the pivotal role of digital literacy in safeguarding against such cybercrimes. He emphasised the significance of understanding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and financial data when sharing them with third parties.He raised a crucial concern about the indiscriminate sharing of mobile numbers and personal information on social media platforms, a practice that could inadvertently expose sensitive data. He advised individuals to remain attentive, drawing a parallel between physical security and digital vigilance.“When individuals share personal information with third parties, they must exercise caution. Unfortunately, I’ve observed people casually sharing their mobile numbers on social media without much thought. A recent example that comes to mind is the sharing of A/Level results. Many students posted screenshots that inadvertently revealed their National Identity Card (NIC) numbers and addresses. This exposes one’s personal information on social media platforms where control over viewership is limited.”Consider an example: Sarah, a university student excited about her A/Level results, eagerly shares her achievements on social media. She posts a screenshot that includes her exam results, full name, and even her NIC number. Unbeknownst to her, this seemingly innocent act exposes a treasure trove of Personally Identifiable Information to potential cybercriminals lurking online.Waidyalankara underscored that the mere usage of social media platforms such as Facebook or WhatsApp did not equate to true digital literacy. Beyond these tools, he advocated for a profound awareness of one’s digital self, a concept that forms the next frontier in cybersecurity.Emphasising the critical role of education in fostering digital awareness, he said: “This is not something that can be done within a day, but certainly there needs to be a concerted effort in schools.” He stressed that everyone, regardless of their profession, must actively participate in safeguarding their digital assets. For instance, journalists, who deal with sensitive information, bear a particular responsibility in this regard. Waidyalankara noted that collective efforts were essential to fortify digital defences. Governments, financial institutions, and telecommunications companies must actively engage in awareness campaigns, as it is a shared responsibility that transcends individual actions.While the spectre of SIM card replication may remain unsubstantiated, the broader issue of cybersecurity looms large. In an era defined by ever-evolving digital threats, individuals must become vigilant guardians of their personal information. By fostering digital literacy and raising awareness, Sri Lanka can fortify its defences against the multifaceted spectre of cybercrime.In an age where knowledge serves as the paramount armour against the shadows of cybercrime, the significance of cybersecurity education cannot be overstated.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/TTVNtBCMlIv8s3WmpSPi,14 Feb 2024 | By Buddhika Samaraweera,Writs of Certiorari filed against SriLankan,"Heli Associates International (Private) Limited, a private company, has filed a Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus application before the Court of Appeal (CA), claiming that it was “unfairly treated” by Sri Lankan Airlines (SLA) in a call for tenders for the purchase of three economy class coaches and seeking an order directing SLA to recall fresh tenders for the said purchase.In the application, the petitioner has stated that SLA had advertised to call bids to supply three economy class coaches under category of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) bearing reference number GSE/ICB1/2023 on 23 January 2023 and the closing date had been indicated as 8 March 2023. ""The petitioner, having perused the relevant specifications and conditions, through their well-connected contacts, identified and selected a viable principle/manufacturer named M/S Xinfa Airport Equipment Limited for the supply of coaches. On 8 March 2023, the petitioner submitted a very competitive bid under seal and signature of their Managing Director along with the relevant documents."" the application read.Speaking to The Daily Morning Business, attorney Gamini Perera who is appearing for the company, said that his client had been selected by the SLA to provide coaches and all credentials of the company had been submitted to the SLA. Elaborating the Chinese company's involvement in the matter, he said: ""These coaches are not manufactured in Sri Lanka and there must be a manufacturer. Accordingly, this company (Heli Associates) had some kind of understanding with the Chinese company as the manufacturer. The SLA now argues that Heli Associates has acted as the Chinese company's agent, but it is wrong. If it acted as the company's agent, it was their (Chinese company) credentials that would have been submitted to the SLA and not those of Heli Associates.""He further said that when Heli Associates was being selected by the SLA to provide coaches through the bidding process, the SLA had wanted to inspect the coaches, and the same had been facilitated by the Company. ""The company was asked to allow them (SLA) to inspect the coaches. The company bore the cost for all matters in respect of that inspection, except for airfare. Everything was done and they (SLA) were satisfied. What the company had shown to them were Chinese company's coaches and the bid was ultimately accepted."" Perera said, and added that the SLA had then asked Heli Associates to allow them (SLA) to place the relevant purchase order to the Chinese company directly, claiming that doing so would be financially beneficial for the Government, to which the company had consented.""During this process, the Chinese company had sent a letter to SLA claiming that they had suspended their partnership with Heli Associates and appointed some other party as their agent. The SLA has accepted it and that new party has now been placed as the bidder. It is wrong for the SLA to do so and they cannot consider that termination to discontinue the petitioner's status as the bidder. A tender is awarded to a certain bidder after a prescribed process. It is with that process that a certain party is accepted as a bidder. There is no possibility to make some party from nowhere a bidder."" he explained.In the petition filed by the company on 13 December, 2023, the SLA, several officials of the SLA's Commercial Procurement Department, the Chairman and members of the relevant Ministerial Procurement Committee, the Chairman and members of the relevant Technical Evaluation Committee, the Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Secretary to the Ministry K.D.S. Ruwanchandra and Attorney General, President's Counsel (PC) Sanjay Rajaratnam have been named as the respondents.The petitioner has requested the CA to issue notices on the respondents, grant and issue a nature of a Writ of mandamus on the SLA to recall a fresh bid process enabling any bidder or agent of any potential supplier/manufacturer to apply for the bidding process as per the published criteria and in accordance with the National Procurement Policy, and grant and interim order on the respondents to stay further proceedings of the currently awarded tender on the said purchase until the final determination of the application.It is learnt that the CA has directed the SLA to file limited objections with regard to the application.When contacted by The Daily Morning, the Chairman of the SLA, Ashok Pathirage said that he was not aware of the matter and would have to look into the same.Ruwanchandra and SLA's Procurement Department were not available for a comment.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/AZKlEkkrmOyexTXJs2LA,31 Mar 2024 | By Sonal Shah and Prabhjot R. Khan,Increasing women’s representation in transport and logistics sectors,"Governments and the private sector in Asia and the Pacific need to take proactive steps to increase the number of women working in the transport and logistics sectors. By doing this, services for women and girls, and the public overall, will improve.Women are significantly underrepresented in transport-related industries and on average make up only 17% of the transport workforce across 46 countries. In Sri Lanka, women constitute 3.4% of the workforce in the transport and logistics sector. In India, almost half of the student population in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) from 2017-2021 were women. In these countries, a lesser number of women workers are employed in the transport and storage sector. In Europe and Central Asia, women make up a quarter of the transport, storage, and communication sectors. These are often in low-paying jobs in administration, sales, catering, and cleaning, while men dominate engineering, driving, and managerial roles. Challenging work cultureWomen face barriers to accessing equal work opportunities and experience challenging and unsafe work cultures in the transport and logistics sectors.In India, workers engaged in the gig economy are expected to grow to 23.5 million workers by 2030. Companies often express concerns regarding women in e-commerce or women delivery workers and their ability to achieve kilometre targets. They often do not have many women above the age of 40 as delivery partners. Warehouses in many cases do not include safe and gender-responsive infrastructure such as secure parking spaces, provision of waiting rooms, rest rooms, and separate clean, hygienic toilets. The attitude and behaviour of male co-workers can also prevent safe, inclusive, and gender-balanced and free-from-harassment work environments.Underlying these sector-specific issues, unpaid household and care work are a barrier for women’s labour force participation and employment in general. Women undertake up to 3.5 hours more unpaid work than men each day in Southeast Asia. In the most extreme cases in Asia and the Pacific, women and girls spend up to 11 times as much time as men on unpaid and household work.Inclusive initiativesWithin this challenging environment, initiatives are underway to include more women in the transport and logistics sectors. Industry, governments, and education institutions have partnered to create channels for women to enter the industry. Awareness campaigns and scholarships to increase women’s interest and enrolment in STEM fields along with targeted placements are attracting more women.The Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure in Turkey has had a female internship programme with 70 interns since 2021 as a part of its rail freight connectivity project. The programme involves a 20-day paid internship in roles across the ministry, including project experience.  Women are playing a bigger role in operations in technical and managerial positions and constitute more than 50% of all positions in operations in the regional rapid transit system between the cities of Delhi and Meerut. The National Capital Region Transport Corporation aims to retain this approach across all the regional corridors in the Delhi National Capital Region. This includes a gender action plan that outlines steps to develop and promote gender-friendly workplace policies.Women-focused facilities are also being created to provide a safe environment. Many original equipment manufacturers and logistics companies have created women-only shop floors and warehouses to create a safe environment and to recruit and retain women workers. In Pakistan, women-only transport services help them feel safer and more accepted, making it easier for them to look for jobs. Over time, this could lead to workplaces and transport services where men and women are more equally included.Ride-sharing companies like Grab in the Philippines and PickMe in Sri Lanka are promoting greater representation of women drivers through special initiatives that are opening up new opportunities for women seeking economic independence. These companies offer flexible work hours, which is a key factor for women joining their network.Women are being hired for customer services, logistics, customer relationship management, sorting and packing as well as in warehousing and hub operations. Ensuring women’s inclusion entails documenting and sharing information from projects, initiatives, and programmes to create organisational policies to recruit and retain women in the transport and logistics sectors. Transforming gender norms and attitudes across transport and logistics sector organisations will be required for sustained change. Employer-based care programmes and community-based care programmes, along with the redistribution of household and care work, will also enable women’s participation in the labour force. Addressing gaps in women’s leadership Women’s leadership in this sector can create role models and provide the impetus for accelerated action towards gender-responsive transport policies. The ‘Asia Women Leaders Programme’ is working to address gaps in women’s leadership in the region. It targets senior women government officials who are in positions to influence their country’s public finance, policies, and services, and provides leadership capacity development, strengthening their knowledge, skills, networks, and confidence. From 2014 to 2023, 266 women leaders from economy, planning, finance, and infrastructure-related ministries have participated in the programme. For women delivery partners, institutional and financial support is required to obtain driving licences and to rent or own two- or three-wheelers (and maintain them). Well-lit, frequent, and safe charging infrastructure in active areas is critical. Separate, clean, and hygienic toilets, rest areas and waiting areas at warehouses, fair wages, flexibility, and paid leave could go a long way in creating a level playing field for women delivery partners. Finally, government regulations that inhibit women’s participation in the transport and logistics sectors need to be evaluated and addressed and gender-responsive infrastructure and services need to be established to increase women’s mobility and employment. We need to invest in women in the transport sector and accelerate progress on gender equality through data, evidence, and intentional action. The transport sector is transforming rapidly. Successfully meeting the sector’s many challenges will need a diversity of people to usher in an inclusive, user-responsive, and sustainable future. This includes a fair representation of women.  (Khan is Senior Social Development Specialist [Gender and Development] – ADB Climate Change and Sustainable Development Department and Shah is Executive Director – Centre for Sustainable and Equitable Cities)

Chandrasiri revealed that after calling for Expressions of Interest (EOIs) earlier this year, the AASL had received EOIs from 19 local and international investors. Thereafter, five successful bids had been received following a bidding process.He stated: “The technical proposals of the five bidders are currently being evaluated by the technical evaluation committee. We will most likely select an investor from among them.”Responding to a query by The Sunday Morning Business regarding the current extent of operations at the MRIA, Chandrasiri conceded that currently only one airline was flying to the MRIA – the Russian Red Wings Airlines, which commenced scheduled charter flight operations to the MRIA from end-2022.He revealed that there were no agreements in the pipeline for any other airlines to commence flight operations to the MRIA. On 8 January, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to the proposal presented by Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva calling for EOIs from investors interested in engaging in business activities using the facilities at the MRIA. Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business previously, Chandrasiri disclosed that proposals had been received from investors who had expressed interest in establishing an aircraft dismantling business and a Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) facility at the MRIA.AASL’s main objective is to leverage the facilities and assets of the Mattala Airport to create PPP investment opportunities. These opportunities aim to attract investors and entrepreneurs involved in both direct and indirect aviation-related ventures, thereby facilitating aeronautical and non-aeronautical businesses at the airport.Since its inception, the MRIA has been plagued by controversy and allegations of corruption. These controversies relating to the construction of the MRIA and its subsequent failure to generate revenue have resulted in it being labelled a white elephant which is an unnecessary burden on the State coffers. Consequently, groups within the present and the previous regime have actively pushed for the privatisation of the MRIA.

The decline in headline inflation is broadly in line with the disinflation path envisaged by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) in 2023.The Food inflation (Y-o-Y) decreased to 47.6% in March 2023 from 54.4% in February 2023, whereas the Non-Food inflation (Y-o-Y) increased to 51.7% in March 2023 from 48.8% in February 2023. Monthly change of CCPI recorded at 2.92% in March 2023 due to price increases observed in items of Non-Food category, which was 3.71%. However, the Food category recorded a monthly decline of 0.79%. The core inflation (Y-o-Y), which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy, decreased to 39.1% in March 2023 from 43.6% in February 2023.Looking ahead, based on the available information, the anticipated declining trend of inflation is expected to continue through 2023, according to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.  This disinflation process is supported by subdued demand conditions owing to tight monetary and fiscal policy measures, softening of food and energy prices amidst the recent exchange rate appreciation and greater pass-through of lower global commodity prices, second round impacts of recent fuel price revisions, and anticipated improvements in domestic supply conditions, along with the favourable statistical base effect.

The Chinese economy expanded by 5.2% in the final quarter of 2023, up from 4.9% in the third quarter. Yet the figure was 0.1% lower than what economists polled by Reuters had expected, hence the disappointment.The news that oil output in North Dakota had fallen by between 650,000 bpd and 700,000 bpd had a limited positive effect on prices as the outage should only last a few days.The International Energy Agency, meanwhile, said it expected a well-supplied oil market this year, bar any geopolitics-related supply disruptions.""If we don't see any major geopolitical surprises, I expect this year to be a comfortable oil market, a more balanced oil market,"" the IEA’s head, Fatih Birol, said in Davos.Speaking of surprises, the conflict in the Middle East is showing no signs of letting up, with a fresh round of attacks on military targets in Yemen by the U.S. and an exchange of strikes between Iran and Pakistan.""Brent crude prices remain broadly stuck in a range as they has been over the past two weeks, as market participants struggle to weigh mixed demand-supply dynamics with prevailing geopolitical tensions,"" IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong told Reuters.ING analysts, on the other hand, pointed to the latest U.S. retail sales data as bearish for oil as it showed stronger-than-expected figures, raising questions about the Fed’s monetary policy this year. The sales data, ING said, largely neutralized Middle Eastern supply concerns. (OilPrice)

Jayasundara.Making submissions before the Supreme Court on the two Fundamental Rights (FR) applications bearing numbers SC FR 195/2022 and SC FR 212/2022 seeking accountability from the Rajapaksas and other leading bureaucrats of the former regime for the current economic crisis, the counsel for Prof. Lakshman pointed out that the CBSL had never issued and published in the gazette a direction fixing the exchange rate at Rs. 203 in terms of the provisions of the Monetary Law Act.Instead, it was argued that the CBSL Governor had merely sought the support of Licensed Commercial Banks (LCB) in navigating the ongoing economic crisis by requesting the banks to maintain the exchange rate at Rs. 203 and that such moral suasion was a legitimate tool available to the CBSL. Moreover, it was further highlighted that the request to maintain the exchange rate at Rs. 203 was in accordance with instructions received from former President’s Secretary P.B. Jayasundara. The counsel for the former Governor pointed out that the same was reflected in the audit report submitted by the Auditor General to the court titled ‘Audit Report Including Observations of the Auditor General Pertaining to the Fundamental Rights Case No.195/2022’. It was further submitted that the CBSL was part of the Executive branch of the Government and, as a result, had a duty to follow the instructions of the President’s Secretary. It was pointed out that the Secretary was essentially speaking on behalf of the President, who was the ultimate authority within the Executive branch.The counsel for the former CBSL Governor further highlighted that the audit report had correctly identified that Prof. Lakshman had promptly informed the Finance Minister by way of the reports submitted under Sections 64 and 68 of the Monetary Law Act, dated 30 June 2021, 26 July 2021, and 14 September 2021, of the need to rethink the exchange rate policy of the Government as the CBSL was unable to maintain the exchange rate. In particular, it was highlighted that Prof. Lakshman had explicitly informed Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa of the need to allow the exchange rate to be determined by the market.

But the visionary Sri Lankan Rohan De Lanerolle Sr. has already come up with a solution: stapler pin-less technology for tea bags. The Daily Morning Business sat with De Lanerolle Sr. for a fruitful discussion on his innovation. His sons, Abacus Tea (Private) Limited Director of Marketing Ishan De Lanerolle and Rohan De Lanerolle Jr. also joined in talking about how their father's innovation could revolutionise Sri Lanka’s tea industry.    Following are excerpts from the interview: How do you prefer to introduce yourself and your positioning in the industry? I am Rohan De Lanerolle Sr., the Chairman of Abacus Tea (Private) Limited and I formed this company around 15 years ago. We have been mostly packing for other companies that export tea in terms of tea bags because I managed to develop a fleet of machines for those companies. With the experience gathered through the active years in the field, can you describe the level of contribution from you and the company to the industry? While it was going on, about five years ago, there was a tendency among tea buyers for stapleless bags. The demand was strong to the extent that companies with stapler pin tea bags were idling. So I was wondering what I would do with the machines in my factory, because I had machines with stapler pins at that time. I started looking at how we could convert these existing machines into stapleless ones. It took about three years of trial and error to manufacture a prototype machine that functions with similar efficiency.  I have built 21 units for these machines for Unilever India and 10 for Tata. Sri Lanka’s George Steuarts Teas has commenced using these as well. Another international company has also inquired about 25 machines; this cannot be named since it is still in the process of discussion. What inspired you to create a stapleless tea bag machine?It was mainly the demand that was created with the assumption that a ban would come into effect in Sri Lanka, since tea bags with stapler pins have been identified as a health hazard.We have 25 machines. If such a ban comes into place, we have to throw away all the machines, thereby disrupting the continuation of the factory. There are over 100 of these (staple) machines in the industry, in the current context. But there are only 20 to 25 stapleless machines in the country. Why should a business utilise your innovation for production? What is the convincing factor?A tea bag machine with staples costs over $ 500,000. On the other hand, this staple-free machine costs only around $ 70,000-100,000. When it comes to Sri Lanka’s tea companies, it saves them one-fifth of the cost compared to a brand new staple machine being imported. At a time the economy is starved for dollars – leading to the prevailing consequences of the economic crisis – it also saves the country’s foreign exchange at a colossal rate.   How have you evaluated the demand in the local market for your innovation, especially from tea exporters?There is a demand by some tea manufacturers, but most of them do not seem to be convinced to purchase a Sri Lankan innovation, while companies such as Tata have indicated its endorsement of our quality. They contacted us during the Covid-19 pandemic through a Zoom meeting, requesting two newly invented machines.   Unlike in Sri Lanka, India endorses “Be Indian, buy Indian”.Do you have any plans in the pipeline for your innovation to increase its speed or for cost reduction?Our next target is to increase its speed. I am in the process of increasing the speed of this machine within the next year. When it comes to cost, the tea bags that are with stapler pins are, in comparison to the market rate, higher in price by twenty cents relative to stapleless ones.          How much has been spent on its infrastructure thus far?Rohan De Lanerolle Sr.: We spent a colossal amount, with trial and error. Ishan De Lanerolle: Thomas Alva Edison said: “I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.” When developing this product, my father’s policy was also the same. He found ways that didn’t work, but they led to results.  Within this innovative process, have you received any sort of State support or sponsorship in promoting your innovation?Absolutely nothing, unfortunately, though we reached out to them. We reached out to several government departments, but nothing has happened. We have reached out to an ex-Prime Minister and an ex-President.  How many of your machines have been upgraded from staple to staple-free?A total of 44 machines have been converted from staple to staple-free. We take the staple unit and replace it with a needle unit.

This was the slowest reading in two years and compares with an 8.4% contraction in the April to June period (2Q).Ankur Shukla of Bloomberg Economics said that demand remained sluggish in Sri Lanka as high inflation and weak confidence kept consumption under pressure.Meanwhile, the DCS stated that agriculture shrank 8.7% in the third quarter and industries shrank 21.2%, while services dropped 2.6%, from a year earlier.The reasons cited were high inflation, power cuts, high interest rates, import shortages, and fuel and fertiliser shortages, which impacted growth in the last quarter. Decrease in the demand of essential and non-essential goods and services due to the reduction of the real income of the people directed the economy towards this decline, it said.According to Central Bank and Finance Ministry data, Sri Lanka is expecting an 8.7% contraction in the economy by the end of 2022 and a 3% contraction by the end of 2023.Speaking to Bloomberg, Sanjeewa Fernando, strategist at CT CLSA Securities, said once the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme is finalised, the risk premium on Sri Lanka will go down, bringing down interest rates with it, and he added that inflows will also have positive bearings on the currency.The Sri Lankan rupee has stabilised since May, but it is still down 80% this year against the dollar. Stocks declined 28% in 2022 and the nation’s 7.55% 2030 dollar bond is indicated at about 29 cents on the dollar. That compares to 51 cents at the start of the year.In a sign of some respite, consumer price gains have started trending downward amid tight policy and falling global commodity costs. Prices hit a record 69.8% between July and September, forcing the central bank to raise borrowing costs to 15.5%. Since then, Sri Lanka’s inflation has slowed and is expected to drop next year.According to Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Sri Lanka missed its initial target of obtaining the approval of the IMF Executive Board in December, but is planning to obtain the approval in January 2023, provided that it obtains financial assurances from creditors in December.

It has been giving loans to South Asian countries.In 2017, the management of a port in the South of the country was handed over to a Chinese firm on a 99-year lease after the debt was not repaid. The incident is widely viewed as an example of “debt trap diplomacy”.Wickremesinghe said China, unfortunately, lacks agencies like the Japan International Cooperation Agency to handle debt issues.He emphasised that the Sri Lankan Government controls the security of the port operated by the Chinese company.He noted that there have been port calls there by Japan’s maritime self-defence force vessels.(NHK Japan)

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/LgKQS7XuZdXmjcYpHQtT,19 Sep 2023,Market reforms can stabilise debt and foster growth in developing countries,"Countries that enacted reforms saw their debt-to-GDP ratios fall by 3 percentage points, on average, over a multi-year periodThe global economy has experienced multiple shocks in the past three years. Emerging markets and developing economies not only need to reignite growth and secure a full recovery, but they also must manage rising debt and other policy considerations.Regulatory changes and other market reforms can ease this challenge, as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) outlines in a new staff discussion note. Examples include lowering barriers to entry in utilities markets, establishing financial supervision and regulatory frameworks, and lowering restrictions on foreign exchange transactions and cross-border capital flows.Major changes in regulations are associated with a three percentage point reduction in the ratio of debt to gross domestic product, according to the IMF analysis. This decline in a key measure of debt burdens takes place not only by increasing GDP, but also by improving public finances through higher tax revenues and lower borrowing costs. The estimated effect is comparable to the effect of major fiscal consolidations, as outlined this year in chapters of the organisation’s World Economic Outlook and Fiscal Monitor.Overlooked debt leverThe typical first step toward stabilising debt is to reduce new borrowing through fiscal consolidation or to decrease the total outstanding through debt restructurings. However, debt-to-GDP ratios can also be cut by increasing the denominator: economic output. One way to accomplish this is with improved market functioning, as IMF research showed in 2016 and 2019.The IMF structural reform database, covering 90 advanced and developing economies over the past four decades, measures how markets work in five broad areas: trade, domestic finance, external finance, product market, and labour market. Due to the large gap in how well markets function between advanced and developing economies, there is considerable scope for governments to use market reforms as a policy lever to revitalise growth and reduce debt burdens in developing economies. Enacting changes in regulations that aim at improving how markets work, for example by increasing competition or establishing appropriate regulatory frameworks, can boost economic output.IMF research shows that improved market functioning not only lowers the debt ratio through the denominator effect, but also strengthens fiscal outcomes and helps reduce new borrowing. However, some market-oriented policies, such as lowering trade barriers, could have the opposite of the intended effect on fiscal accounts. Scrapping tariffs, for example, would – at least in the short term – reduce tax revenue and could in turn increase debt. This may be partially offset in the longer term, however, by increased economic activity.How reforms stabilise debtThe IMF finds that gains from reforms materialise through higher tax revenues and narrower sovereign debt spreads. The higher tax revenues likely reflect that the effect of improving economic activity makes up for lost revenues directly linked to reforms. The lower borrowing costs instead reflect the improvement in investors’ confidence after the reforms.The analysis also shows that some reforms work better than others. For example, the debt reduction associated with reforms is larger when governments are better at collecting taxes, have higher initial debt, and implement reforms during an economic expansion. This means that, while reforms help reduce debt on average, that’s not always true in every circumstance.Another factor dampening the gains from reforms is increased government spending. Historically, developing countries have used some of the fiscal gains from reforms to fund other policy initiatives. Challenges from the political dynamics during the implementation period have also limited the fiscal gains. Spending carefully, then, is a key factor for reforms to successfully reduce debt ratios.Ultimately, ensuring that reforms strengthen debt sustainability calls for several policy considerations:Countries’ initial debt burdens and potential inequality effects are important factors in deciding how fiscal gains from reforms can be directed toward debt reduction, growth-friendly spending, or income inequality concerns.Improving efficiency in tax collection can enhance the gains of an enlarged tax base, for example by investing in digital infrastructure, governments can strengthen revenue mobilisation and improve spending efficiency, as noted in a recent IMF report.Another factor dampening the gains from reforms is increased government spending. Historically, developing countries have used some of the fiscal gains from reforms to fund other policy initiatives. Challenges from the political dynamics during the implementation period have also limited the fiscal gains. Spending carefully, then, is a key factor for reforms to successfully reduce debt ratios.Overall, reforms are essential to improve how markets work and spur long-term growth. The IMF research finds that such reforms also have an important potential to help countries navigate the challenging balancing act of supporting growth while stabilising debt that many emerging market and developing economies currently face.(IMF Blog)

When the Government has taken a policy decision, banks which are operating under licences issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) must have some respect for the Government’s policy decision,” he stated.   The Minister observed that the morally dubious conduct of such LCBs had been countered by courts, which had granted interim orders suspending the auctions in almost every instance, citing the Government policy decision.Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business previously, Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSME) Chamber Member Susantha Liyanaarachchi revealed that the chamber believed that parate auctions should not take place from the date of issuance of the gazette on parate suspension, which was 13 March.Moreover, he said that although some of the auctions had been published in newspapers, the banks, upon inquiry, had stated that only auctions related to loans that had been in default before 2019 had taken place.In April, a State-owned national newspaper carried auction announcement advertisements from banks such as Nations Trust Bank, DFCC Bank, and Pan Asia Bank on the sale of properties due to defaulted loans, mainly in the construction sector. On 26 February, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal submitted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as Finance Minister, which proposed that the banks’ practice of acquiring properties in relation to loans that were yet to be paid off be suspended until 15 December and that Section 4 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act No.4 of 1990 be amended to facilitate the necessary legal provisions.

However, it widened compared to February 2024 ($ 319 million).Meanwhile, the cumulative deficit in the trade account from January to March 2024 was higher ($ 1,229 million) than the deficit recorded over the same period in 2023 ($ 896 million).According to the CBSL, the increase in expenditure on consumer goods imports in March 2024 compared to a year ago was due to an increase in expenditure on food and beverages imports, although there was a decline in non-food consumer goods imports (led by lower medical and pharmaceuticals).Meanwhile, expenditure on intermediate goods imports increased primarily due to higher fuel imports compared to March 2023. However, expenditure on textiles and textile articles, wheat and fertiliser significantly decreased in March 2024.Expenditure on investment goods recorded a broad-based increase, driven primarily by higher imports of building materials and machinery and equipment. Meanwhile, expenditure on imports in March 2024 increased significantly compared to February 2024 primarily due to the normalisation of fuel expenditure.With respect to the tourism sector, the CBSL noted that tourism earnings in March 2024 were estimated at $ 338 million, in comparison to $ 346 million in February and $ 189 million in March 2023.Meanwhile, the workers’ remittances amounted to $ 572 million in March 2024, as opposed to $ 568 million in March 2023 and $ 476 million in February.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/yOpNFglLuHHdC2nXiuRU,12 Feb 2023 | By Tanya Shan,Can a ‘slip of the tongue’ prevent an IMF bailout?,"SJB Leader publicly declares refusal to work with IMFHarsha corrects statement; says will work based on 2 conditionsEconomists see no solution to crisis from SJB and NPPSamagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Leader Sajith Premadasa recently stated publicly that should his party rise to power, Sri Lanka would not be working with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These remarks were made by the Opposition Leader when Sri Lanka was about to receive IMF Executive Board approval for the $ 2.9 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) bailout package. Premadasa’s statement was corrected by SJB MP Dr. Harsha de Silva the following day, stating that Premadasa had not meant that the SJB would not work with the IMF if it came into power, but that the party would work based on two conditions which included raising the Personal Income Tax (PIT) threshold to Rs. 250,000 and the revision of corporate taxes. While noting that this was merely a political statement, University of Colombo Faculty of Arts Department of Economics Professor Athula Ranasinghe questioned as to what alternative the SJB was proposing if it was unwilling to work with the IMF.“I believe that the IMF is not the only solution and that there are many others. But if the SJB says that it will not choose the IMF, it should disclose the alternatives. We need solutions, not criticisms,” Ranasinghe told The Sunday Morning Business. Further, he noted that since it was a political statement, it meant nothing more, indicating that the statement would not harm the ongoing bailout programme. Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, University of Peradeniya Faculty of Arts Department of Economics and Statistics Professor Ananda Jayawickreme opined that Premadasa had made a slip of the tongue and what he had actually meant was that the SJB would negotiate and implement mutually accepted measures rather than working under agreements with ad hoc policies. Jayawickreme said that the SJB would obviously wish to work with the IMF and that it did not have anything against the fund, as the SJB had been advocating and pushing the Government to approach the IMF when the economic crisis had been unfolding, indicating that the party was in favour of the decision to seek the fund’s support. However, it was opposed to the unfair ‘deal,’ by which Premadasa had meant certain policies implemented by the Government due to the IMF’s push, Jayawickreme opined. Details of the IMF agreement Sri Lankan authorities and the IMF team reached a Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) last September to support the country’s economic adjustment and reform policies with a new 48-month EFF.The new EFF arrangement will support Sri Lanka’s programme to restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, while safeguarding financial stability, reducing corruption vulnerabilities, and unlocking Sri Lanka’s growth potential. The agreement is subject to the approval by IMF management and the Executive Board in the period ahead, contingent on the implementation by the authorities of prior actions and on receiving financing assurances from Sri Lanka’s official creditors and making a good faith effort to reach a collaborative agreement with private creditors. Debt relief from Sri Lanka’s creditors and additional financing from multilateral partners is required to help ensure debt sustainability and close financing gaps.Increasing the PIT threshold “Minister Bandula Gunawardena at one point said that the IMF’s initial request had been to tax anyone who earned over Rs. 45,000 per month. If we had gone ahead with this proposal, it would have been a huge disaster. Rs. 45,000 per month means nothing now. You cannot live on this amount with the current cost of living,” Jayawickreme stated. The SJB has stated that if it were elected to power, it will renegotiate the PIT minimum threshold with the IMF and increase it to a minimum of Rs. 250,000.It should be noted that the initial minimum taxable monthly income proposed by the IMF was Rs. 45,000, as claimed by Co-Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Bandula Gunawardena at a press briefing a few weeks ago. However, the Government managed to negotiate and bring it up to Rs. 100,000.MP and former banker Eran Wickramaratne recently stated that the minimum taxable income should be set at Rs. 250,000, as some earners were required to look after themselves and their families and hence could not be considered a ‘burden’ to the State. “They are working with dignity. Don’t go and mess with that. Otherwise, they will be dependent on the State, such as for benefits and welfare. This is not the first time we have highlighted this issue; we said the same thing when the Budget was presented in Parliament. People will come up with all kinds of theories but you have to be practical, because if you create an increasingly dependent class, it will be like trying to solve one problem by creating a bigger one,” Wickramaratne said. Meanwhile, National People’s Power (NPP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake recently told the media that taxes must be imposed for those with a minimum income of Rs. 200,000 and above and that the maximum tax rate must be reduced by 24%.However, Prof. Ranasinghe believes that the Rs. 150,000 minimum tax threshold is a fair limit.  Meanwhile, delivering his speech during the Fourth Session of the Ninth Parliament on Wednesday (8), President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that should the Government abolish the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) tax as per the people’s request, the State would lose a whopping Rs. 163 billion in revenue and that the current circumstances were not favourable for the State to afford such a huge loss. He noted that should the minimum tax threshold be extended to Rs. 200,000 as suggested by many, it would result in the State losing Rs. 63 billion in tax revenue, which the Government was unable to bear under the prevailing conditions. “Some have also opined that the minimum tax threshold needs to be increased from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 200,000. Several others say that the PAYE tax system needs to be abolished altogether. Our circumstances are not in favour of losing such a sum of money. Since the economy of the country is fragile, we all feel the tax burden and because the revenue from direct taxes is low, Sri Lankans pay a huge sum in indirect taxes,” Wickremesinghe explained.Lack of economic policies of SJB and NPPMeanwhile, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) Vice Chairman Duminda Hulangamuwa last week said that the CCC did not see a proper alternative solution put forward by the SJB or the NPP for Sri Lanka’s economic crisis.He said that the CCC had conducted many discussions in the last eight to nine months, mostly with the SJB and the NPP in addition to other political parties and that both parties had failed to provide satisfactory solutions to the economic crisis, other than the solution already implemented by the incumbent Government.Hulangamuwa stressed that the solutions presented by the SJB and NPP were no different to the current path followed by the Government.“When asked about an alternative path, I have not received a satisfactory answer from them. They say this is the only way,” he added.Nevertheless, he said that the CCC agreed with SJB and NPP that corruption and corrupt policies should be eliminated to solve existing political and social problems. “However, in terms of the economy, I don’t see a solution other than the one we are currently following,” Hulangamuwa noted.Further, he said that should the minimum taxable personal income be increased to Rs. 200,000 and the rate be brought down from 36% to 24%, the Government would face a loss of tax revenue, which would prevent the Treasury from reaching its estimated revenue levels. Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, SJB MP Tissa Attanayake, in response to the CCC Vice Chairman’s remarks, stated that the SJB had proposed 20 measures to overcome the economic crisis to Parliament and that these had been viewed by the Speaker as well. Attanayake noted that the Vice Chair’s opinion was merely an individual political opinion and assured that SJB indeed had a plan. Meanwhile, NPP MP Vijitha Herath, when asked about Hulangamuwa’s remarks, noted that power should first be given to the NPP to see how it overcame the crisis, adding that he had nothing else to say.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/vw155Z9p7TUexkrwwnho,08 Aug 2023,PA calls for urgent facilitation of crop diversification,"The Planter’ Association of Ceylon (PA) renewed calls for urgent action from policymakers to greenlight diversification into more lucrative crops like oil palm, in the wake of a sharp reduction in prices of tea and rubber over the first half of 2023 (1H23).Following on record prices in 2022, when tea moved from Rs. 704.7 per kilogram up to Rs. 1,245.2 per kg in June, and up to an all-time high of Rs. 1,599.5 per kg by September, prices have been on a steady decline in 2023. Starting from Rs. 1,466 per kg in January 2022, average prices have since reduced to just Rs. 974.4 per kg by June 2023. This amounts to a 24.4% Year-on-Year (YoY) reduction, and a drastic 40.3% reduction between Jan-June 2023. Rubber prices too experienced significant volatility throughout 2022, moving from Rs. 461 per kg of Grade 1 Ribbed Smoked Sheets (RSS1) up to an annual high of Rs. 800 in June 2023, before collapsing back to Rs. 472.7 per kg in January 2023. While rubber prices have appreciated marginally to Rs. 536.3 per kg in June 2023, average prices of rubber for 1H23 were 21.4% less than the corresponding period of 2022. “Sri Lanka’s plantation industry is in urgent need of a realignment. The price dynamics over the past 6 months show strong signs of a continuing downturn across both tea and rubber. Tea prices have been impacted by increasing production in competitor nations, while rubber prices affected by continuing supply-demand mismatches in the wake of the COVID pandemic. Demand for finished rubber products, while showing marginal improvements, has been relatively stagnant compared to the past 3 years. Sri Lanka’s low productivity is also eroding our ability to compete with larger regional producers.“While we maintain that there must always be a place for Sri Lankan tea and rubber, we have to acknowledge that securing the future of our nation’s plantation industry requires extensive crop diversification. We can no longer limit ourselves to just two main crops. Already significant investments are being channelled across the RPC sector into an array of crops – from a wide range of fruit cultivation to coffee and even several varieties of berries. However, we note with disappointment that there has still been little to no progress on expanding sustainable oil palm cultivation,” PA Chairman Senaka Alawattegama noted.  Palm oil is well understood to be significantly more profitable than tea and rubber. Based on 2020 data, on average, palm oil generates a profit per hectare of Rs. 605,000 as compared with Rs. 269,600 for coconut. By contrast, both tea and rubber are currently generating losses. This in turn means that palm oil can generate significantly larger volumes of foreign currency earnings utilising significantly less land and other agricultural inputs. At present, local consumption is around 264,000 MT, from which only about 20-25% is produced locally. Expanding in coconut from the present 40,000 MT to meet the shortfall is neither economically viable nor technically feasible. Presently, Sri Lankan palm oil cultivation covers approximately 12,000 Ha, less than 1% of the total agricultural land in the country. In 2021, the country paid an average of Rs. 475 per kg for imported crude palm oil. The same imported crude palm oil in India costs Rs. 300 per kg. The massive taxes (55% of the total CPO price) imposed on imported palm oil in Sri Lanka to balance it with coconut oil prices will only make sense if backed up by a comprehensive plan for expanding local oil palm cultivation.Currently, Sri Lanka’s local consumption of edible oils stands at approximately 264,000 MT, with only about 20-25% being produced domestically. Expanding coconut production from the current 40,000 MT to bridge the gap is neither economically viable nor technically feasible.Conversely, Sri Lanka's palm oil cultivation covers about 12,000 Ha, which is less than 1% of the total agricultural land. In 2021, the country paid an average of Rs. 475 per kg for imported crude palm oil, while the same product costs Rs. 300 per kg in India. The significant taxes (55% of the total CPO price) imposed on imported palm oil in Sri Lanka to match coconut oil prices would only be justified with a comprehensive plan to expand local palm oil cultivation.

Furthermore, he stated that Sri Lanka Tourism, together with the private sector, had organised a roadshow in China in April, covering the cities of Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou.  Elaborating further, he stated: “We will hold a press conference in mid-March, where we will reveal our mid- to long-term promotional plans for our nine key markets including China.”Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Chairman Priantha Fernando noted that China had traditionally been a major tourist market for Sri Lanka, despite an interruption over the past two years after China closed its borders due to Covid-19. However, Sri Lanka Tourism is projecting 1.5 million tourist arrivals in 2023, with around 240,000 projected from China.“We have plenty of demand from China. However, the issue is in catering to the demand. SriLankan Airlines will have around nine flights per week and the Chinese carriers will have around three flights per week. This is not enough. “Even if we had a 100% load factor, the number of tourists that can be brought down is not sufficient in comparison to the demand. Therefore, we have commenced discussions with other airlines on how we can increase the seat capacity from major generating points in China to Sri Lanka,” Fernando stated. In 2019, China was the third largest source market for Sri Lanka Tourism, with 167,863 arrivals amounting to 8.8% of the total 1.3 million tourist arrivals recorded. Similarly, China was the second largest source market in 2018 with 265,965 arrivals, accounting for 11.4% of the 1.6 million total tourist arrivals recorded that year.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/XjJhPB8RDYhNkU74vcBY,14 Dec 2022,Sri Lankan industries to explore sustainable energy future,"Leaders from across industries, civil society, finance, and academia met in Colombo earlier yesterday (13) to explore short and long-term energy solutions for Sri Lanka, amidst the country’s worst-ever energy crisis. With Sri Lanka’s industrial sector among the largest consumers of costly imported fossil fuels, more than 100 participants heard from experts and shared their insights into how this economically important sector can move towards more sustainable energy use.“By decoupling Sri Lanka’s industrial development from the use of imported fossil fuels, we can avoid energy crises in the future and help slow down global climate change,” said Minister of Environment Naseer Ahamed during his opening remarks. Minister of Industries Dr. Ramesh Pathirana stated: “The industrial sector employs 30% of the national workforce, so it’s essential that we future-proof this sector.”Organised by the European Union (EU)-funded “Accelerating Industries, Climate Response in Sri Lanka” (AICRSL) project, the event’s highlight was a panel discussion between leading energy experts and innovators. With expertise in leveraging finance, new technologies, and international trade in a changing world, the panellists shared some of the latest developments in the area of sustainable industrial energy.Speaking at the event, EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Denis Chaibi stated: “As global markets demand products with lower carbon footprints, we are eager to help Sri Lanka reap economic benefits by tapping into niche markets that seek sustainably produced goods while also acting on climate change. This is part of the external dimension of the EU’s Green Deal, our blueprint for securing a sustainable energy future.” Meanwhile, a showcase of Sri Lankan Energy Savers, people in industry and Government who are already helping improve energy use, was on display at an in-event exhibition. Those attending were invited to nominate other Energy Savers whose efforts should be recognised – and could inspire others to take similar action.    “Every transformational story needs people who will take on a challenge, run with it, and make change happen. Sri Lanka’s Energy Savers are exactly that: Courageous industry leaders and energy practitioners determined to help the country slash industries’ energy waste and greenhouse gas emissions. I look forward to seeing more Energy Savers emerge as the initiative progresses,” said United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) Project Manager Nicholas Dehod. The event is the first in a series of industry dialogues planned by the AICRSL project – a Rs. 2.8 billion (EUR 7.56 million) partnership between the Sri Lankan Government, the EU, and UNIDO. This effort is designed to help the country’s industrial sector cut its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 7% by 2030. The initiative will achieve this aim by supporting industries to use more renewable energy, such as solar PV and biogas, and improve energy efficiency. The five-year initiative will work across a wide range of areas, including measurement, reporting, and verification of GHG emissions and creating policies to support industries to move to low-carbon technologies. Hundreds of industry managers and service providers will gain expertise on renewables and energy efficiency, and funding opportunities will be unlocked to increase low-carbon technology investments. Industry dialogues and other events will be held throughout the initiative to enable the Government, the business community, the finance sector, and civil society to share the technical knowledge, insights, and solutions needed for a low-carbon future.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/fuGTbVMbN8syd2cIFTeq,13 Aug 2023,SL’s objections to Hamilton bond ownership deemed ‘speculative’,"Speculative challenges don’t hold against motion for summary judgement: HRBHamilton Reserve Bank (HRB), in its latest filing before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, has dismissed the recent objections raised by Sri Lanka regarding HRB’s beneficial ownership of the bonds against the motion for summary judgement as a mere “speculative challenge”.In its latest filings dated 31 July 2023, HRB has taken the position that Sri Lanka’s response to HRB’s motion for summary judgement was focused solely on a “speculative challenge” to HRB’s beneficial ownership of the bonds, arguing that such speculations are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgement.HRB asserts that a summary judgement can be rejected only when matters of fact are in dispute and that Sri Lanka’s “speculation and conjecture as to the true nature of facts” in relation to HRB’s beneficial ownership of the bonds is not sufficient to raise a genuine dispute of fact. Furthermore, HRB has insisted that it has provided sufficient evidence of its beneficial ownership of the bonds in question and alleged that Sri Lanka has failed to show the nature of the incomplete discovery.Moreover, HRB has challenged the legality of the expert opinion filed by Sri Lanka, which argued that, being a regulated bank, it is improbable for HRB to purchase bonds worth $ 250 million on its own account when such bonds are well below investment grade. According to HRB, in terms of the procedural rules, Sri Lanka was barred from filing such an opinion without disclosing it before 20 June 2023, which was the deadline for discovery.Since the inception of this litigation, HRB has continuously alleged that it holds, as the beneficial owner, bonds with a principal amount of $ 250,190,000 in Sri Lanka’s $ 1 billion 5.875% International Sovereign Bond (ISB) issuance due 25 July 2022, effectively claiming ownership of 25% of the ISB series.  However, Sri Lanka, in its response to HRB’s motion dated 26 June 2023 for summary judgement, raised issues regarding HRB’s purported beneficial ownership of the bonds. Accordingly, Sri Lanka made an application for further discovery of documents to prove that HRB had put its own capital at risk as opposed to engaging in a swap or other arrangement with a third party and therefore was the actual beneficial owner of the bonds.Thereafter, in response to the above objections raised by Sri Lanka, HRB, in its motion for summary judgement, surprisingly revised the claimed principal amount of its beneficial ownership from the initial $ 250 million stated in its complaint filed on 21 June 2022 to $ 243 million.However, HRB had thereafter, in a declaration filed in court on 7 July 2023, under the hand of its Chief Financial Officer Antonio Kenyatta, alleged that it had acquired additional bonds worth $ 7.5 million on 6 July 2023, thereby increasing the total principal amount it asserts as its beneficial ownership to approximately $ 250 million, aligning with its initial assertion of owning over 25% of the bond issuance.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/sLzw4XjDv9cM13RkzVnt,26 Feb 2023 | By Dr. Sanjay Basu,Is responsible AI synonymous with AI ethics?,"The terms ‘responsible AI’ and ‘AI ethics’ are often used interchangeably, but they refer to two distinct concepts. While both are concerned with ensuring that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is developed and used in a way that is fair, safe, and beneficial to society, they approach this goal from different perspectives.Responsible AI focuses on the practical aspects of implementing ethical principles in the development and deployment of AI systems. It involves creating processes, systems, and tools to ensure that AI is designed and used in a way that aligns with ethical values and considers the potential impacts on society. This area can include things like establishing governance structures, developing ethical guidelines and frameworks, and creating mechanisms for transparency and accountability.AI ethics, on the other hand, refers to the philosophical and moral principles that underlie the development and use of AI. It involves examining the ethical implications of AI technologies, considering the potential consequences of their use, and determining what actions and policies are morally right or wrong. This area can include things like examining the fairness of AI algorithms, considering the potential impact of AI on society and individuals, and determining how to balance the benefits of AI with the potential drawbacks.In short, responsible AI is about creating systems and processes to ensure that AI is developed and used in an ethical manner, while ethics in AI is about understanding and analysing the ethical implications of AI technologies. Both are important for ensuring that AI is used in a way that’s fair, safe, and beneficial to society.Who should be responsible for the development and upkeep of responsible AI?The development and deployment of AI technology have the potential to greatly impact society and the economy, making it a topic of significant debate and discussion. One important question is whether the responsible development of AI should be primarily the responsibility of engineers including the product owners, or whether it should be governed by policy and governance.Some argue that the responsibility for ensuring the responsible development of AI should fall primarily on the shoulders of engineers. These individuals design and build AI systems, and so they have the expertise and knowledge necessary to ensure that these systems are developed in a safe and ethical manner. They can use their knowledge of AI and its capabilities to design systems that avoid bias, protect user privacy, and prevent misuse. Along with engineers, these groups can include other AI professionals too. As my esteemed colleague JR Gauthier states: “Ensuring that an AI system is fair, unbiased, [and] ethical is the responsibility of the product owner, the owner of the AI system. Defining what’s ethical for any AI system is very hard to do and most (if not all) engineers are not trained or skilled to answer that question. It should really be a group made of the product owner, the AI system dev lead, legal counsel, CRO or risk officer, [and more].”On the other hand, others argue that the responsibility for ensuring the responsible development of AI should be the domain of policy and governance. AI technology has the potential to impact society and the economy on a large scale and so it requires oversight and regulation to ensure that its use is safe and beneficial for all. Policymakers and government officials can create regulations and guidelines to ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible manner and they can hold organisations accountable if they fail to do so.So far, the progress in this space isn’t very satisfactory. Neither any prescriptive steps to create ethical AI or any actionable items have been made.While both engineering and policy and governance have important roles to play in ensuring the responsible development of AI, the responsibility ultimately falls on both to work together to ensure that AI is developed and used in a way that’s safe and beneficial for society. Engineers can use their expertise to design and build AI systems that are safe and ethical, while policymakers and government officials can create regulations and guidelines to ensure that these systems are used in a responsible manner. By working together, we can ensure that AI technology is used to benefit humanity and improve our world.Who should be responsible for AI ethics for industries and society?AI has been growing rapidly in the past few years and with its increasing presence in day-to-day business operations, organisations have started to recognise the need for ethical practices when it comes to how they use AI. As such, several key players have emerged as responsible for developing standards and guidelines for the ethical use of AI within the enterprise.Governments have been involved in the development of AI ethics. Some countries, such as China, have already implemented regulations that govern the use of AI within enterprises. Other countries are beginning to develop their own regulations on how organisations can ethically deploy AI tools to protect consumers and workers. Governments are also taking part in international discussions to ensure that common standards are established on a global level.With governments, individual businesses have also recognised the importance of ethical AI development and usage within their organisations. Companies are now taking steps toward ensuring that their AI systems are following ethical guidelines, such as conducting risk assessments, understanding relevant regulations and laws, and using AI responsibly. Moreover, some organisations have created dedicated ethical committees or positions to oversee the development and deployment of AI technology within their organisations.Numerous non-profits and research institutes are working toward establishing ethical standards for how companies can use AI to protect consumers and employees. These organisations include the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, the Institute for Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence, and the Responsible AI Initiative. They’re actively researching and developing industry guidelines and creating awareness campaigns to ensure that companies are using AI responsibly.To summarise, governments, businesses, and research organisations have all been involved in the development of ethical standards for how AI can be used within enterprises. This important step helps ensure that businesses are using AI responsibly and protecting consumers and employees.(The writer is a Senior Director and the Head of AIML Solutions and Services [Cloud Engineering] at Oracle)

Owing to this positive performance trend, Amana Bank has declared six successive annual dividends, demonstrating the bank’s commitment to deliver value to its shareholders. The bank recorded its best ever annual PBT in 2022, which has been exceeded already within the first nine months of 2023, with the bank expecting the trend to continue. The continued acceptance of its people-friendly banking model resulted in Amana Bank being one of the fastest banks to surpass the Rs. 100 billion mark in total assets in 2020, which now, along with the rights issue proceeds, stands in excess of Rs. 150 billion. Expressing his gratitude, Amana Bank Chairman Asgi Akbarally stated: “We are profoundly grateful for the support demonstrated by our valued shareholders towards raising Rs. 6 billion through the rights issue, especially in the context of challenging economic circumstances. Their trust and confidence in our vision have contributed significantly to meet the regulatory minimum capital and fortify our capital adequacy levels. With this success, Amana Bank is well poised for the next phase of its growth, while continuing to reward its valued shareholders.” Echoing these sentiments, Amana Bank Managing Director/CEO Mohamed Azmeer said: “Successfully undertaking a rights issue during a challenging market environment is a testament to the unwavering trust and support of our existing shareholders, while also demonstrating the confidence of new investors in our unique model and performance. The fresh capital infusion has placed us on a stable launch pad for future growth, allowing us to expand our core business while capitalising on promising opportunities to ensure optimal shareholder value in gratitude for their investment.”

With higher card volumes coupled with an increased adoption of our digital services, net fee and commission income grew by 31% YoY to Rs. 4.2 billion. The positive sentiments brought on by the IMF programme and the improved foreign exchange liquidity, gave way to a partial relaxation of foreign exchange controls. This led to the appreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee by approx. 10% during the three months up to March 2023. This resulted in the Bank recording a net exchange loss of approximately Rs. 2 billion for the quarter due to revaluation losses.  Despite vulnerabilities in the operating income, the Bank was able to maintain one of the best asset quality positions in the industry, with the net stage III loan ratio at 3.8% and stage III provision cover at 55.5% as at end March 2023. Having made significant provisions on account of impairment in 2022, the Bank made a total impairment of Rs. 11.4 billion for the quarter. This consisted of impairment on loans and advances and other off-balance sheet exposures of Rs. 6.7 billion, and impairment of Rs. 4.7 billion on foreign currency denominated government securities. Operating expenses increased by 26% in 1Q 2023, driven largely by the impact of the higher inflation compared to the corresponding period of 2022. However, growth in income outperformed that of cost, translating to a cost-to-income ratio of 26% for the first quarter of 2023. Hatton National Bank PLC Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Alles noted: “Following an unprecedented year mired in challenges, with the banking sector wrestling with multiple headwinds, we are pleased to see HNB’s performance in the first quarter of 2023. Securing the IMF Extended Fund Facility will bring in the much-needed credibility to restore investor confidence, allowing Sri Lanka to gradually regain access to foreign capital markets. Moving forward, it is imperative that the debt restructuring framework is finalised, ensuring that the stability of the financial sector is safeguarded.”“In the current backdrop, our prime focus has been on managing asset quality, capital and liquidity levels. The success of our delivery is reflected in our above par indicators. We have continued to stand by our customers. supporting them through extremely difficult times to stay afloat and we look forward to supporting their growth, as the operating environment improves further. The pandemic led to a shift towards online channels and this enabled an exponential growth in our digital adoption levels. We expect to see further growth as we continue to add value to our digital banking platforms for our retail as well as wholesale banking clients.”“The foundation of HNB’s success rests with our people and I am truly grateful to be part of a fantastic team with unwavering dedication. While the road ahead may not be smooth, we look forward to the opportunities that arise with optimism.”The effective tax rate for the quarter increased to 36% from 19% in Q1 2022 mainly due to the increase in corporate tax rate from 24% to 30% and introduction of social security contribution levy with effect from October 2022. Since December 2022, the asset base grew to Rs. 1.7 Trillion as at end 1Q 2023. As a result of low demand for credit due to high interest rates and a stronger Rupee, the Bank’s gross loan book dropped by 4% to Rs. 1.0 Trillion during the quarter. On the other hand, Bank deposits continued its growth trajectory, expanding by Rs. 29 billion to reach Rs. 1.4 Trillion. The Bank reported Tier I and Total Capital Adequacy Ratios of 11.41% and 14.43% against the minimum statutory requirements of 9.5% and 13.5% respectively. The Bank has provision to draw down further up to 250 bps on the capital conservation buffer under the concessions granted by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. HNB’s liquidity levels also continued to be strong and well above the regulatory minimum requirements, with Statutory Liquid Assets and all currency Liquidity Coverage ratios at 39.31% (vs. a 20% requirement) and 353.42% (vs. a 100% requirement) respectively.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/g5xmTjOwUHfnn1XOrXUC,29 Jan 2023,A basketful of issues,"Sri Lanka is one of the oldest tea producing nations with a presence spanning over 150 years in the industry. With a global market share of 5%, Sri Lanka is also one of the largest tea producers, but its recent performance has been somewhat murky.Manufacturers remain concerned about a number of issues that could possibly dampen Ceylon Tea’s global significance further. The fertiliser issue is the biggest concern as the Government’s move to ban the import of chemical fertilisers had a negative impact on the sector. Climate change is considered the biggest issue facing the industry. A study by the Dilmah Conservation Centre for Climate Change Research and Adaptation points out that a number of climatic parameters such as rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature, sunshine hours, relative humidity, and wind velocity affect tea yield, quality, and the growth of pruned tea.According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, increased temperature could cause soils to dry, which in turn reduces yields. The organisation suggests that newly suitable land areas need to be found when the situation becomes extreme.Further, with factories adding sugar and glucose in the process of tea production, another concern is that a number of companies are involved in the adulteration of tea.Making matters worse, tea yields have been on the decline due to the low tea replanting rate and lack of infilling. Sri Lanka requires a minimum of 2% capacity of its total tea production to be replanted annually, but currently, barely 1% is replanted. Despite the higher costs, tea replanting works as a solution to soil erosion in tea estates. The next major concern for manufacturers is the cost of production in the industry. Due to the high cost of production, companies are finding it difficult to pay wages to their workers.Being the largest agricultural product in the country’s export basket, the tea industry has been contributing significantly to Sri Lanka’s overall foreign exchange earnings. The industry consists of players at all levels from large-scale plantations to smallholders.Ceylon Tea, which has long been part of the nation’s pride, is gradually losing its global market share. Kenya was once behind Sri Lanka but has now surpassed even India, becoming the world’s largest tea exporter.A competitive environment and timely and prompt adaptation of long- and short-term strategies should certainly be called for to address the issues listed above and many others that prevail in the industry, as these have the potential to push Sri Lanka further down the list of global exporters of tea.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/WaLnWUvn1jpTLzBgwwqT,15 Oct 2023,Securing food security,"World Food Day falls on 16 October. In Sri Lanka, food security has been a topic of discussion for a considerable period of time, especially gaining prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic. During that period, there was confusion between food security and self-sufficiency. Instead of focusing on ensuring food security, the emphasis was placed on self-sufficiency, with the belief that all food consumed in Sri Lanka should be produced within the country. There were even discussions among Sri Lankans about shifting from using lentils (dhal) to locally-grown maize.After approximately two years, when we assess the Global Food Security Index report, Sri Lanka is ranked 79th out of 113 countries. Food security isn’t solely about achieving self-sufficiency by producing all the food within the country; it encompasses the affordability, availability, quality and safety, as well as a nation’s exposure and resilience to natural resource risks.Prior to the inclusion of the natural resources and resilience component, Singapore led the Global Food Security Index. However, after adding this component in 2022, Singapore dropped to the 28th position, with Finland now topping the Index. India is in the 68th position, Nepal in the 74th position, and Bangladesh in the 80th position, just one spot below Sri Lanka.Due to the economic crisis, characterised by high inflation rates, particularly in food prices, the number of people who were food insecure exceeded six million. This number has now decreased to less than four million, emphasising the significant role economic stability plays in ensuring people’s food security.Sri Lanka’s food security has always been a challenge due to economic policies that have been against market dynamics. Monetary instability resulting from the unfettered levels of money printing led to food inflation, affecting the affordability of food. The Government’s imposition of price controls led to shortages of protein sources such as eggs and chicken, further impacting the availability of food. Additionally, the Government imposed a Special Commodity Levy (SCL) on selected food items as a protectionist measure, maize being a prime example, driving up prices. Maize is a key raw material for the aquaculture and poultry industries. Price volatility in maize also affects the prices of poultry products and other locally consumed protein sources, sometimes impacting the competitiveness of our agricultural exports. The Government’s approach, whether through higher tariffs or import bans, is equally detrimental. Our food security structure is simply unsustainable, with weak and unpredictable supply chains and inconsistent policies.Ensuring food security involves addressing both macro and micro issues. A holistic approach, taking into account land rights, is essential. The documentary recently released by the Advocata Institute titled ‘Land, Freedom and Life’ highlights the challenges faced by farmers due to the absence of land rights, hindering their access to capital or technology to enhance productivity.In addition to land rights, water management is another critical aspect that needs serious consideration. Currently, our water usage in paddy cultivation is unsustainable. We consume approximately 1,400 litres of water to produce 1 kg of rice. Even if we price a litre of water at 50 cents, the cost of the rice we consume would significantly surpass current prices. With the challenges posed by climate change, future water availability cannot be guaranteed. Despite the number of people experiencing food insecurity declining, our approach in food production is not sustainable. Another local or global shock could easily set us back.The Government has attempted various approaches such as providing subsidies for farmers, free meals for school children, and free nutritional packages for women during maternity. However, in order to truly  address Sri Lanka’s food security crisis, a multifaceted approach is required. This should begin with macroeconomic stabilisation, providing land titles for farmers and agro-companies to enhance agricultural productivity, reducing labour costs in agriculture, recognising the interconnectedness of markets, and allowing market forces to operate.Until these issues are resolved, World Food Day will remain a day for discussing problems without implementing solutions.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/HN3bY8GuJ2Rs0PJgJlUz,12 Oct 2023,CCC stresses importance of digital ID,"The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) together with industry stakeholders, stresses the importance of implementing a digital ID system to propel the transformation of the Sri Lankan economy. As a foundational pillar of a digital Economy, the digital ID holds immense potential to play an integral role in reshaping economic revival, safeguarding vulnerable communities with effective benefit transfers, enhancing tax revenues, and accelerating development.“We believe that the implementation of the digital ID is an absolute necessity for our nation's growth and prosperity. It is the catalyst that will usher Sri Lanka into a new era of a digital economy, ensuring we remain competitive on the global stage,” the Chamber said in a recent media release.CCC Chairman Duminda Hulangamuwa emphasised that the provision of a distinctive digital identity for both citizens and businesses through the digital ID not only streamlines processes and enhances compliance, but also drives efficiency in Governmental transactions. The CCC also urged the Government to expedite and finalise this crucial initiative.  Valuable lessons can be drawn from the experiences of nations such as India, Singapore, Thailand, and Kenya which have made significant strides by investing in comprehensive digital ecosystems encompassing digital ID, digital payments, and broadband infrastructure. These countries exemplify how robust digital public infrastructure can accelerate economic growth and enhance global competitiveness.The Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) and the Sri Lanka Association for Software Services Companies (SLASSCOM) further stressed the imperative need to fast-track the implementation of the digital ID. “The digital ID is the baseline for all digital transformation in the country, encompassing both the Government and the private sector”, FITIS Chairman Indika de Zoysa stated. Meanwhile, SLASSCOM Chairman Jehan Perinpanayagam encouraged “authorities to expedite the implementation of this project, as it is very much in line with the vision of a digital economy shared by the President, and will be vital in the reform agenda, preventing fraud and mismanagement, widening the tax base, and improving efficiencies for all citizens”.According to the statement, the CCC is committed to facilitating a digitally progressive Sri Lanka, and is keen to collaborate with the Government and other ecosystem stakeholders to create an enabling environment for the implementation of the digital ID.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/7AqNvcWIdycFc360IGt7,23 Feb 2023,Fitch affirms Sri Lanka’s Dialog Axiata at ‘AAA(lka)’; Outlook stable,"Fitch Ratings has affirmed the National Long-Term Rating of Sri Lanka-based telecom company Dialog Axiata PLC at “AAA (lka)”. The Outlook is Stable.The affirmation and Stable Outlook reflect Fitch’s view that Dialog will be able to maintain a credit profile commensurate with a “AAA(lka)” rating in the next 12-18 months, despite lower demand for telecom services, escalating costs, and a significant increase in the company’s debt amid the Sri Lankan rupee’s devaluation.Dialog’s rating is driven by its Stand-Alone Credit Profile (SCP) of “AAA(lka)”, which reflects its market leadership across mobile, pay-TV and home-broadband (HBB) segments, better execution and network capability and a solid financial profile, offset to an extent by the high exposure of its revenue to the weak Sri Lankan market.Weak demand in 2023: Fitch expects Dialog’s revenue growth to slow to around 10% in 2023, from 25% in 2022, amid weakening consumer spending. Consumers are increasingly prioritising essential needs, such as food and medicine, as real income has plunged following the currency depreciation and unprecedented high inflation. Dialog faced pressure on subscriber numbers and usage minutes in 2022. Telecom operators raised voice and data tariffs by 20% and pay-TV by 25% in 2022 to pass through the escalating costs, reducing the services' affordability.Fitch believes the recent increases in telecom taxes would also discourage demand as consumers now have to pay 38% tax on voice and 20% on data. Sri Lanka currently has one of the highest telecom tax structures in Asia. To mitigate its domestic market exposure, Dialog is increasingly focusing on its international businesses and enterprise clients, who are somewhat immune to the local environment. The contribution from international business climbed to 23% in 2022, from 16%-17% earlier.Market leadership: Dialog is the domestic market leader across mobile, pay-TV and HBB segments. The competition within the mobile segment has intensified in recent months amid the falling demand, with some of the smaller operators aggressively cutting prices. However, Fitch does not believe such a strategy is sustainable as the smaller telcos do not have the network capability, service quality or financial strength to compete with operators such as Dialog.Low profitability: Fitch expects Dialog’s EBITDA margin to improve to around 30%-32% over 2023-2024 from 28% in 2022, benefitting from the recent tariff hikes and cost rationalisation measures. Dialog’s EBITDA margin contracted by 12 percentage points in 2022 amid the high inflation and currency depreciation. Around 52% of Dialog’s direct costs are in foreign currency (FC) compared with only 30% of its revenue, exposing the company to currency volatility.Dialog expects to streamline its costs by consolidating its facilities, optimising its network and rationalising overheads, but we do not believe this will be sufficient to improve margins to the 39%-40% levels before 2022. The low realisation of the recent tariff hikes amid the drop in usage and increased contribution from the low-margin international business would also mean margins would remain in the low-to-mid 30s range in the next few years.High foreign-currency debt: Around 91% of Dialog’s outstanding debt was in FC at end-2022. The depreciation of the rupee by almost 80% in 2022 materially increased Dialog’s FC debt exposure, while it had to raise more FC debt to fund capex amid the FC shortage in Sri Lanka. Fitch does not believe Dialog’s current FC revenue is sufficient to meet its FC debt obligations, but the company does not have any FC debt repayments due in the next 24 months. Dialog has $ 41 million in FC deposits to meet its FC interest costs of around $ 12 million per year.Balance-sheet restructuring: Dialog is planning to manage its currency exposure by reducing the FC debt to less than 50% of its outstanding debt by end-2023. It is considering asset monetisation and alternative funding arrangements with existing lenders to achieve a more balanced funding mix. The higher debt stock also raised Dialog's EBITDA net leverage to 1.3x in 2022, from 0.4x in 2021. Fitch expects leverage to remain around 1.0x until there is a sustainable recovery in margins.Positive FCF from 2024: Fitch expects Dialog to generate negative free cash flow (FCF) in 2023 amid low profitability and high capex. Dialog’s capex has risen due to the currency devaluation as most of the equipment is imported. Therefore, Fitch expects capex intensity to rise to around 27% of revenue in the next few years from around 23% earlier. Capex will be spent mostly on mobile and fixed-data capacity expansion to cater to the growing demand. Dialog’s FCF should turn positive from 2024, once EBITDA margins gradually recover.Support from strong parent: Fitch’s assessment of “Medium” legal and strategic support incentive from its stronger parent, Axiata Group Berhad, would result in a potential two-notch uplift to its rating if its SCP were to weaken, according to our Parent and Subsidiary Linkage Rating Criteria. Axiata guaranteed around 45% of Dialog’s debt as of end-2022. The subsidiary makes a reasonably material financial contribution to the parent, with moderate long-term growth potential. The operational support incentive is “Weak” due to minimal operating synergies with the parent.Sector outlook deteriorating: Fitch expects the average 2023 net debt/EBITDA ratio for Dialog and fixed-line leader Sri Lanka Telecom PLC (SLT, A(lka)/Stable) to weaken to 1.4x in 2023 (2022E: 1.2x) amid weak margins and high capex. Fitch expects sector revenue growth to slow to 8% in 2023 (2022E: 15%), while the average 2023 EBITDA margin for SLT and Dialog will remain flat at 32% (2021: 38% and 2022E: 32%) amid low usage and high costs.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/WpWwMrLacE02BKEXr1i6,07 Jan 2024,Escaping economic exodus,"As Sri Lanka navigates the convoluted maze of its fiscal policies, the toll it exacts on its citizens and the economy stands as a stark reminder of the urgent need for reform. The compounding impact of soaring living costs, an intricate tax structure, and the looming threat of a brain drain requires not just immediate attention but a comprehensive overhaul of the country’s economic strategies.The repercussions of these fiscal burdens reverberate across every stratum of society. The rising costs of essentials, exemplified by inflated fuel and LPG prices, together with the staggering 18% VAT, disproportionately affect the livelihoods of citizens. The burden amplifies for middle and high-income earners, who face a myriad of direct levies, from PAYE deductions to Advance Income Tax on interest earnings, further diminishing their disposable income.Even everyday transactions, such as dining at local restaurants or purchasing goods and services, are encumbered by an intricate web of levies and taxes, strangling consumer spending and slowing down economic circulation. This convoluted tax system fosters a suffocating environment that not only impacts citizens’ purchasing power but also hinders the growth of small businesses and entrepreneurship.The complexity of Sri Lanka’s tax structure is, in itself, a barrier to economic growth and social development. Economists have long championed the benefits of direct taxation while cautioning against the pitfalls of an overly convoluted tax system. Sri Lanka, unfortunately, finds itself entangled in a hybrid of direct and indirect taxes, resulting in citizens paying taxes both directly and indirectly, leading to an inflationary pressure that is set to rise further.This conundrum has direct implications for the future of the nation. The looming exodus of skilled individuals, driven by a quest for better opportunities abroad, poses a direct threat to Sri Lanka’s prosperity. This brain drain risks hollowing out the country of its talent pool, stifling innovation, and obstructing economic growth. The cycle repeats – a talent exodus leading to economic stagnation.To break free from this spiral, Sri Lanka must enact substantial reforms in its fiscal policies. A simplification of the tax structure, a move towards more direct taxation, and a reduction in the burden on its citizens are imperative. Policies should prioritise stimulating economic activity, encouraging investment, and nurturing local entrepreneurship.Efforts to alleviate the tax burden on citizens, especially the middle class, will not only bolster consumer confidence but also spur economic growth. Simplifying tax regulations, reducing indirect taxes, and offering incentives for investment and innovation are vital steps toward a more equitable and thriving economy.Moreover, comprehensive policy changes should encompass long-term strategies to retain local talent. Investments in education, research, and infrastructure, coupled with creating an environment conducive to innovation and entrepreneurship, can reverse the brain drain and retain the country’s brightest minds.The road to economic stability and growth demands audacious steps. Sri Lanka stands at a critical juncture where the decisions made today will shape its economic trajectory for decades. The transformation of its tax structure and a reinvigoration of policies to retain talent are not just prudent choices but fundamental imperatives to usher in an era of sustainable growth and prosperity. The time for action is now, and the vision for a brighter future lies in the hands of decisive policy reforms.

He said that he had obtained details from various people who held eminent positions of the previous governments which are subjected to the said research; Mahinda Rajapaksa Government, Good Governance Government and Gotabaya Rajapaksa Government.According to Herath, the research report is to be published in a way that the general public can refer it and also submit it to the Parliament for the reference of the MPs. Former secretaries to the Ministries, Advisors to the aforementioned governments, civil society organisations have contributed to the said report. He said that this report has been prepared without being partial to anyone, even though he himself had served in several positions under these Governments.He said that this report will be completely different from a traditional report made into similar issues and will come out before many other committees appointed with the same purpose.  Herath started preparing this report following the resignation of the majority of Opposition MPs from the special Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) set up to probe the country’s financial bankruptcy and Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa’s decision to appoint a committee for the same.Herath noted that particular research report will include wide revelation about the frauds and malpractices taken place in the development projects and foreign borrowings carried out by the second Government under then-President and incumbent Government MP Mahinda Rajapaksa (2010-2015); the foreign borrowings and fiscal transparency during the “good governance” Government led by then-President and incumbent Opposition MP Maithripala Sirisena and then-Prime Minister and incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe (2015-2019); and the period of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and then-Premier Mahinda Rajapaksa (2020-2022).

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/AoFuFmTs3X9FoiiGqgeh,10 Jan 2023 | By Imesh Ranasinghe,Banks foresee low impact from standing facilities limitation,"LCBs do not expect huge shift of investors from deposits to Govt. securitiesNote investors with high liquidity already moved to securities some time agoLimitation to reduce interest rates in short- to medium-termBanks do not expect a huge shift of investors from bank deposits to short-term Government securities after the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) limited access to overnight standing facilities, as investors with the required liquidity had already shifted to securities offering higher rates, The Morning Business learns.Speaking to us, a top-level banker from a private bank said, the move by CBSL to bring interest rates down by limiting access to overnight liquidity facilities will not see a huge amount of shift in people investing in Government securities rather than in banks, as the shift has already taken place with 4-5% higher rate offered by securities rather than a bank deposit.Although the CBSL’s expectation is the diversion of investors to Treasury Bills and Bonds, sources claimed that any investors in possession of some sort of liquidity have already gone through that particular path.The CBSL limited the availability of overnight liquidity facilities to Licenced Commercial Banks (LCBs), as the availability of the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) will be limited to fives times for a particular LCB in a calendar month, while the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) will be limited to 90% of the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) at any given day.Another banker who preferred to be not quoted told The Morning Business that reducing the policy rate is ineffective to bring down the interest rates, as the market rate almost doubled the policy rate. Therefore, the Central Bank has to use another measure to reduce the interest rates in the short- to medium-term, which they are trying to achieve by limiting access to standing facilities.According to the CBSL, in November 2022, Average Weighted New Fixed Deposit Rate (AWNFDR) was at 24.05%, while the one-year Treasury Bill was at 29.46%  In a statement last Saturday (9), the Central Bank said that the liquidity deficit in the domestic money market, which remained significantly high during the first half of 2022, declined in the latter part of 2022. However, in spite of the improvements in money market liquidity conditions, market interest rates continued to remain high, partly due to subdued activity in the domestic money markets.At the same time, the CBSL said that it has been observed that several LCBs have continued to depend excessively on the overnight standing facilities under Open Market Operations (OMOs) of the Central Bank without considering market-based funding options to address their structural liquidity needs.The CBSL said that the imposition of the limitations on the standing facilities is expected to reduce the over-dependence of LCBs on the overnight facilities offered by the Central Bank and support the reactivation of the domestic money market, which remained nearly inactive for the last few months while encouraging LCBs to transact among themselves. These measures would also eliminate unhealthy competition for deposits among financial institutions and would be instrumental in inducing a moderation in the market interest rate structure (of both deposit and lending interest rates) in the period ahead, along with improving market liquidity conditions.Speaking to The Morning Business, First Capital Holdings Head of Research Dimantha Mathew said that as investors are cut off from overnight liquidity facilities, there is a higher demand for short-term instruments, pushing the yield rates down.He also said that the other alternative for investors is to lend in the market for banks and primary dealers, which will improve liquidity in the system, and that the SLF limitation will not have a major impact.By the end of the first week of January 2023, Total Overnight Market Liquidity reduced to Rs. 191.19 billion from Rs. 205 billion at the start of the week and the Total Outstanding Market Liquidity was at Rs. 321.19 billion.

So growth has to come. The question is:from where is the growth going to come?”He pointed out that in 1995, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam exports earned around $ 3.5 billion. Today, Sri Lanka exports around $ 12 billion, however, Vietnam exports around $ 80 billion and Bangladesh exports around $ 400 billion which is a massive growth while Sri Lanka has not experienced any growth in the export industry.“When our competitors went from toys to radios, from radios to TVs, from TVs to electronics, from electronics to telephones, from telephones to component manufacturing to rockets. We are still stuck in apparel.”He explained if Sri Lanka is going to manufacture simple products, it is going to stagnate in low wages.

Today’s aircraft orders reflect that strategy.“These additional aircraft will enable Emirates to connect even more cities, supporting the Dubai economic agenda D33 set out by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, to add 400 cities to Dubai’s foreign trade map over the next decade. By the early 2030s, we expect the Emirates fleet to be around 350-strong, connecting Dubai to even more cities around the world.”Emirates’ Boeing orderEmirates, already the world’s largest operator of Boeing 777 aircraft, has signed firm orders for 55 additional 777-9s and 35 777-8s. This takes the airline’s 777-X order book to a total of 205 units.Emirates also confirmed an order of 202 GE9X engines to power the additional 777X aircraft ordered yesterday taking its total GE9X engine order to 460 units.From its previous order of 115 units, the first 777-9 is expected to join Emirates’ fleet in 2025. Yesterday’s additional orders mean Emirates will induct new 777-9s to its fleet until 2035.With this latest order, Emirates is also set to be one of the launch customers of the 777-8 passenger variant, with first deliveries expected in 2030.Sheikh Ahmed said: “Emirates is the biggest operator of Boeing 777 aircraft, and today’s (13) order cements that position. We’ve been closely involved in the 777 programme since its start-up until this latest generation of 777X aircraft. The 777 has been central to Emirates’ fleet and network strategy of connecting cities on all continents non-stop to Dubai. We are pleased to extend our relationship with Boeing and look forward to the first 777-9 joining our fleet in 2025.”“This order is an incredible vote of confidence in the efficiency and versatility of the 777X family to meet Emirates’ needs for global long-haul travel,” said Deal. “The 777-9 and 777-8 are the perfect aeroplanes to support Emirates’ growth plans, improving environmental performance, and unmatched payload capability.”The 777 remains the backbone of Emirates’ operations, capable of missions of up to 18 hours that enable the airline to connect Dubai non-stop to cities on six continents.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/C45fBUSHVaBr2PgvVweo,03 Jan 2023,"Dubai scraps 30% alcohol tax, licence fee to boost tourism","Dubai has scrapped its 30% alcohol tax in an apparent bid to boost tourism.It will also stop charging for personal alcohol licences – something residents who want to drink at home must have.Dubai has been relaxing laws for some time, allowing the sale of alcohol in daylight during Ramadan and approving home delivery during the pandemic.This latest move is thought to be an attempt to attract more foreigners to the city, in the face of competition from neighbours.The two companies which distribute alcohol in Dubai, Maritime and Mercantile International (MMI), and African and Eastern, said they would reflect the cut in tax for consumers.“Since we began our operations in Dubai over 100 years ago, the emirate's approach has remained dynamic, sensitive and inclusive for all,” MMI spokesman Tyrone Reid told AP.“These recently updated regulations are instrumental to continue ensuring the safe and responsible purchase and consumption of alcoholic beverages in Dubai and the UAE.”It is not clear if the move, which took effect on Sunday (1), will be permanent. The Financial Times described the move as a one-year trial, citing “industry executives informed of the decision”.Expatriates outnumber nationals by nine to one in Dubai, known as the Gulf’s “party capital”, and residents commonly drive to Umm al-Quwain and other emirates to buy alcohol in bulk.Dubai has historically managed to attract more tourists and wealthy foreign workers than its neighbours, in part because of its tolerance of a more liberal lifestyle.But now it faces increasing competition from rivals developing their hospitality and finance sectors.Non-Muslim residents in Dubai must be at least 21 years old to drink, transport, or store alcohol at home and have an alcohol licence – a plastic card issued by the Police.(BBC)

US crude dropped 28 cents, or 0.3%, to $ 76.65 per barrel.Both benchmarks plunged more than 4% on Tuesday (3), with Brent suffering its biggest one-day loss in more than three months.“Warning signs of global recession, China’s lacklustre recovery with surging Covid-19 cases, renewed strength in the US dollar and dampened risk sentiment are all catalysts keeping oil prices in check overnight,” said IG Market Analyst Yeap Jun Rong, in a note.The Chinese Government increased export quotas for refined oil products in the first batch for 2023, signalling expectations of poor domestic demand.Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia may further cut the prices for its flagship Arab Light crude grade to Asia in February after they were set at a 10-month low this month, as concerns of oversupply continued to cloud the market. “The market remains worried about the impact of macro factors such as the economic downward pressure,” said analysts from Haitong Futures.The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that much of the global economy would see a tough year in 2023 as the main engines of global growth – the US, Europe, and China – are all experiencing weakening activity. The Fed had raised interest rates by 50 basis points (bps) in December after four consecutive increases of 75 bps each. If the Fed intensifies its rate hikes, that could slow the economy and hamper fuel consumption.Lending oil some support, the dollar weakened yesterday after posting big gains in the previous session.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/pYCKxp2C0jaeBgC70ohe,01 Jan 2023 | By Shenal Fernando,Be patient till Mattala Airport becomes profitable: AASL,"Normal for new airports to make losses: AASL Chairman MRIA cannot be made profitable overnight: Nimal SiripalaThe controversial Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) in Hambantota is once again in the public spotlight and is the recipient of the public’s ire following the recent revelation by the Auditor General that the operating cost of the MRIA for 2021 was Rs. 2.02 billion, which was 21 times higher than the operating income during the same period.However, speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd. (AASL) Chairman Major General (Retd) G.A. Chandrasiri pointed out that the Mattala Airport had been abandoned for around five years under the previous regime and that the MRIA had commenced generating revenue only from end-2021 onwards following the strenuous efforts undertaken by the AASL and other related Government agencies to attract airlines to MRIA.Elaborating further, he stated: “We were able to get several Central Asian airlines such as Uzbekistan Airways, Air Kazakhstan, and Wizz Air to come to MRIA. Until around April 2022, we were generating a steady flow of revenue. However, with the economic downturn and the political and social unrest in the country, all these airlines withdrew.”Since its inception, the MRIA has been plagued by controversy and allegations of corruption. These controversies relating to the construction of the MRIA and its subsequent failure to generate revenue have resulted in it being labelled a white elephant which is an unnecessary burden on the State coffers. Consequently, groups within the present and the previous regime have actively pushed for the privatisation of the MRIA. Arguments in favour of MRIAWhile admitting to the claims made in the Auditor General’s report, Chandrasiri pointed out that the current financial pains observed were to be expected in a new airport and that the MRIA’s presence as an alternative to the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) was strategically important and justified its existence because in an emergency, an international flight scheduled to land at the BIA would be forced to go to the Chennai Airport in the absence of the MRIA. He urged for patience with regard to the MRIA, stating that while it may not be profitable at present, its future commercial importance to the country was undeniable and therefore it should not be dispensed with simply because it was not generating profits yet.Similar sentiments were expressed by Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva who, speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, stated that as the second international airport in the country the maintenance of the MRIA was of strategic importance for Sri Lanka.He further stated that on 29 December 2022 a chartered flight from the Russian Red Wings Airlines had arrived in the country with 425 passengers and would thereafter commence scheduled flights to Sri Lanka twice a week.He stated: “We are hopeful that the Red Wings Airlines will, after some time, increase the frequency to four flights a week. In this manner, we must progressively develop the MRIA because it represents an attractive alternative to the BIA for certain tourists who are targeting the southern region of the country. This cannot be done overnight and will take time.”     Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, LIRNEasia Chair Prof. Rohan Samarajiva pointed out that while there had existed a controversy regarding the location of the MRIA when it had been constructed, following the extension of the Southern Expressway to Matara, the MRIA had relatively easy access to most parts of the Southern Province. This development, together with MRIA’s reasonable levels of access to the Eastern Province, has created a modest tourism potential within the airport.“It is possible for MRIA to cater to the tourism market to an extent. It will never do the same numbers as BIA but it is possible for it to serve as a tourist airport, provided that a coordinated marketing campaign is undertaken. Therefore, if tourism businesses on the east coast, the south, and other places such as Ella – which are accessible from the MRIA – properly market the access provided by MRIA to such locations, it is possible for it to be successful,” he explained. Development of MRIAThe Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation revealed that following Cabinet approval, Expressions of Interest (EOIs) from potential investors for the development of the MRIA had already been called for.“We have called for EOIs for any development in the MRIA or its management. I have already presented the Cabinet paper and received approval to call for EOIs from interested parties,” he explained.Elaborating further, he said that the MRIA had the capacity to accommodate various auxiliary businesses within the airport which included businesses such as courier services, aeronautical engineering, and aircraft dismantling.AASL Chairman Chandrasiri stated that several EOIs had already been received, including a proposal to establish an aircraft dismantling business in Sri Lanka.“Once the lifetime of an aircraft is over, its final resting place will be in Sri Lanka. They will land at the MRIA and the relevant company will dismantle the entire aircraft and resell the components as spare parts. We are hopeful that we will be able to start this soon in Mattala,” he said.He further stated that another EOI had been received from a Singaporean company to establish a Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) facility at the MRIA. “We are currently engaged in discussions with them. We should not forget the immense commercial opportunities available at the MRIA. We are currently working tirelessly for the realisation of these economic opportunities.”According to Prof. Samarajiva, the MRIA has the potential to serve as the regional air freight hub for international courier service, pointing out that the South Asian hub of DHL Express was not located in South Asia, which represented an opportunity to be exploited by MRIA. A case for private sector operation of MRIAMinister de Silva further stated that while there was no definite plan to privatise MRIA, if an attractive proposal was received from a suitable investor seeking to operate the MRIA under a Public Private Partnership (PPP), the proposal would be duly considered in the best interests of the country.However, Prof. Samarajiva stated that the term privatisation had no meaning with regard to private sector involvement in an airport, because the land would not be given to the private party and the State would operate as the landlord, receiving rent for the use of the airport and its land. He pointed out that calls to involve the private sector in the MRIA were regarding the operation and management of the airport.“There is plenty of precedent here [operation of airports by private sector parties]; you can look at Hyderabad, Mumbai, or New Delhi. All the high-end airports in India which are doing well are operated by the private sector. It doesn’t mean they own the airport, they merely operate it and that’s what we should look for; someone to operate MRIA and not to sell it off,” he explained.Elaborating further, he stated that the most appropriate model would be a PPP model because the Government would have to incur certain expenditures with regard to the operation of the airport, as the costs of security, immigration, and customs operations must be borne by the Government. “Such expenditure for services provided by the Government can be compensated for by a levy imposed on the tickets or through some other suitable manner.”He pointed out that the extent of the private sector participation in the operation of the airport, specifically with regard to the operation of the control tower, baggage handling, ground handling, and catering services could be determined during the negotiations with the private investor.

There are shortcomings still, many aspects which we should further strengthen, but the economy is developing,” he said.Moreover, he said creating such negative reports on Sri Lanka is “not morally correct” when the foreign investors turned their attention back on the country and the stock exchange demonstrated a positive situation.Semasinghe noted that it was a Herculean task to convert the crisis in 2022 to the current situation by August 2023. “In that instance, if someone thinks that putting all the conditions (agreed with the IMF) inside a box and ticking whether those conditions are met or not is the approach to bring the country out of the crisis and go for economic growth in 2024, that is not the way,” he added.  A recent report by the Colombo-based think tank Verité Research said that Sri Lanka had verifiably met 35 of the trackable commitments of the IMF programme as of the end of July 2023, but had failed 7. “Despite the apparent advancement, Sri Lanka's progress in meeting its commitments has been sluggish, and there is a growing concern of not meeting commitments,” Verité Research pointed out in the report.Semasinghe further said that Sri Lanka has agreed to fulfil 95 varying conditions under the EFF programme and there are timeframes for meeting those conditions. “If some change is happening in those timeframes and targets, we discuss them with the IMF and will follow the most practical method,” he said.Therefore, he said that making statements without the knowledge of the discussions and understandings between the Government of Sri Lanka and the IMF is not fair.The IMF spokesperson announced that its staff team is to visit Colombo in September for the first review on Sri Lanka's loan programme. Accordingly, the first review is to take place from 14-27 next month (September), which would consider the programme's performance until June. Once it is approved by both the staff and the Executive Board of the IMF, it would allow a disbursement of around $338 million.

They will be having a daily flight coming into Jaffna. And the number of tourists from India has been increasing, and with the ferry service, it will increase further.”According to the Ports Authority, it has been 12 years since Sri Lanka received the initial proposal for the Indo-Sri Lanka ferry service. The Indian and Sri Lankan Governments held discussions regarding commencing the ferry service following the war and despite the best efforts, the Ports Authority was unable to make it happen. Last year, Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva resumed discussions in this regard with the Indian High Commissioner following which they identified the advancements and enhancements that have to be made at Sri Lanka’s end. The improvement of Kankesanthurai (KKS) Harbour’s infrastructure was recommended during the discussions as it had deteriorated due to the effects of the conflict where the Ports Authority had constructed a passenger terminal with a cost of Rs. 450 million.However, India has recently demonstrated their willingness to run the ferry services from the Nagapattinam port to the KKS port. A ferry operator has contacted the Ports Authority three days ago.From a commercial perspective there will be more trade taking place between the countries apart from tourism, it was highlighted. Moreover, there are reportedly a number of inquiries coming in from the diaspora for investment in Jaffna. The SLTDA has acquired land in Delf Island, which will also be available for investment, Fernando explained.The ferry service will have the capability of ferrying approximately 300 passengers, which accounts to nearly four times the number of passengers on a flight to Jaffna. There would be two weekly ferry runs from India to Jaffna if the ferry service is launched.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/EwKDqLnXlldr0LUIn2kS,07 Jan 2024 | By Prof. Anura Wijayapala,Can EVs be a win-win for SL’s transportation industry?,"A common unfortunate experience shared by Sri Lankans is being exposed to clouds of unpleasant emissions from Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. This is a growing challenge, especially considering Sri Lanka’s ageing vehicle fleets. Accordingly, 70% of Sri Lanka’s total air pollution is attributed to the transport sector. According to statistics released by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), there are more than 1.1 million ICE vehicles operating in Sri Lanka, excluding three wheelers and motor bicycles. There are over one million three wheelers and over 4.5 million motorcycles all running on ICEs. Still, fewer than 10,000 Electric Vehicles (EVs) are on the roads while there are a substantial number of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) which are powered mainly by ICEs. This means that the development of Sri Lanka’s transport sector has created a significant economic burden in the past decades. It is time we modernise our vehicle fleet, which has been put on hold due to the recent economic crisis.Further, adding to the burden, Sri Lanka imports 100% of its fuel requirement, of which 70% is consumed by the transport sector and according to the latest official data released by the Ministry of Power and Energy, Sri Lanka’s total fuel consumption as of August 2023 stood at over Rs. 2 billion despite fairly high fuel prices.With the depletion of global crude oil resources, uncertainty in global price hikes, and current environmental issues such as climate change, air pollution, and noise pollution, an alternative to conventional vehicles is now more than necessary.Minister of Transport and Highways Dr. Bandula Gunawardana recently unveiled a Government plan for 2024 to be the ‘E-mobility year’. As a result, there is greater interest in EVs in Sri Lanka than ever before. However, can EVs offer a viable solution for Sri Lanka’s transportation challenge?What is the way forward?I believe that a partial or complete replacement of ICE with EVs could lead to an overall reduction in fuel consumption. This will enable reduced emissions, which could help improve the quality of health and reduce Sri Lanka’s overall Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.Research conducted by the University of Leeds in the UK shows that this may be a feasible option. The research found that electric cars are cheaper to own and run than petrol or diesel cars in the UK, the US, and Japan, partly because of government support. It is also said that electric cars are expected to become the cheapest option, even without subsidies. However, for Sri Lanka, it is disheartening to observe that the growing demand for electric cars in 2015 hit a stumbling block due to increased taxes in 2016 and an import ban on vehicles in 2020.If Sri Lanka wishes to accelerate the growth of EVs, our Government can take the example of foreign governments like the US, the UK, and China. For example, tax reduction components and providing concessions can encourage widespread EV adoption.Adopting alternative energy sources not only contributes to foreign exchange savings on fossil fuels but also encompasses reductions in expenditures related to vehicle spare parts, maintenance accessories, and lubricants. This multifaceted approach mitigates reliance on traditional, and often, depleting resources and opens avenues for creating new business ventures and employment opportunities. By embracing sustainable practices, societies benefit economically, environmentally, and socially, paving the way for a more resilient and forward-thinking future.According to the Nationally Determined Contributions report, Sri Lanka has committed to reducing GHG emissions by 25% from the energy sector and 10% from other sectors (including transportation) against the business-as-usual greenhouse gas emission projections in 2030.  Therefore, accelerating the adoption of EVs can be considered a ‘win-win’ situation for Sri Lanka and its people.One of the best ways of achieving this target for Sri Lanka would be to follow the Norwegian Government’s example. They plan to make all new cars sold in the country zero-emission by 2025, primarily focusing on electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles. As of the end of 2022, 20% of registered cars in Norway were Battery-Electric Vehicles (BEVs), holding a market share of 79.2%. This rapid transition is credited to well-implemented policies and various Government incentives; as such, Sri Lanka can also decide on following similar policy-based principles.The role of energyIn 2022, Sri Lanka’s overall electricity generation amounted to 15.9 terawatt hours, as reported by the Ceylon Electricity Board statistical report. Additionally, renewables constituted 52.1% of the total electricity generation in the same year, according to data from the report.Hence, even with the widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles, the increase in electricity demand is not expected to significantly impact the Government’s overall electricity production or grid capacity in Sri Lanka over the next decade. For example, by encouraging EV charging during off-peak times with lower tariffs, the overall load curve of the electricity demand can be further flattened, making the capital investments more efficient.Based on this data, it is evident that individuals, even without solar power, will be able to discover that running an Electric Vehicle is much more cost-effective than using an ICE vehicle in Sri Lanka.Diesel used in power plants can generate more electricity than directly using it in vehicles. While a litre of fuel in an ICE vehicle covers 10-12 km, that same amount in an efficient power plant can produce about five units of electricity. Even accounting for a hypothetical loss of one unit during generation, transmission, and distribution, the remaining four units can power a vehicle for approximately 24 km. This demonstrates the efficiency and environmental advantages of using diesel for electricity generation compared to its direct combustion in transportation. For those already utilising solar power, there is zero cost involved. However, for non-solar users, a maximum domestic electricity charge will cost approximately Rs. 80. In contrast, an external charging facility supplied by the service provider costs approximately Rs. 160 per unit at present. Whatever the source, it is still economically sensible. Even at Rs. 160 per unit, when an EV runs 6 km, it costs a little over 25 Rs./km, while ICE engine-driven vehicles will cost significantly more. This is in addition to significantly lower vehicle maintenance costs.Advancements in technologyFurther, we have seen a vast improvement in battery technology, which has changed the EV industry, introducing energy-efficient batteries that extend the overall travel range and charge time.The inaugural Nissan Leaf, introduced in 2010, featured a modest 24 kWh battery with a driving range of 100-135 km when charged overnight. Over the years, the industry has undergone a paradigm shift, witnessing a significant leap in energy storage capabilities. Currently, the third generation of electric cars hold a 60 kWh battery, which enables EVs to extend their driving range beyond 350-450 km on a single charge in under 45 minutes or less.The synergy of innovation, engineering prowess, together with crash and post-crash safety tests has culminated in these cutting-edge batteries, affirming the viability of Electric Vehicles as a practical, safe, and formidable alternative in the global automotive landscape.To illustrate, let’s take the most commonly used EV in Sri Lanka and the latest addition to the market – BYD, introduced through the recent partnership with John Keells Holdings PLC, aimed at providing zero-emission vehicles to Sri Lanka.ModelNissan LeafBYD DolphinYear of manufacture 20152023Range135 km410Battery technology24 kWh lithium-ion44.9 kWh LFP blade batteryConsumer benefitsThe total private cost of ownership of cars includes the purchase price and depreciation, taxation, insurance, and fuel or electricity infusion. Let us first factor in the most crucial cost-effectiveness calculation when choosing an EV over an ICE vehicle.Similarly, maintenance costs play a significant role in comparing traditional ICE vehicles to electric cars. ICE vehicles incur substantial expenses for engine upkeep as they age. Routine tasks such as changing engine oil, coolant, transmission fluid, and belts contribute to the overall cost of ownership.In contrast, electric cars lack internal combustion engines, eliminating these specific maintenance expenses. The most substantial maintenance cost for an electric vehicle typically arises from replacing the battery pack, an expense that may only occur after 10-13 years of use. This demonstrates that using Electric Vehicles is the most cost-effective solution for consumers.In conclusion, I have personally experienced the advantages of transitioning to an EV, particularly evident during the peak of the fuel crisis when I avoided long queues at gas stations. Despite owning an older EV, I have enjoyed substantial cost savings in terms of both fuel purchases and maintenance expenses. I am confident that these benefits can be extended to other vehicle users, especially with the introduction of newer, high-quality EVs entering the market.This positive trend underscores the need for the Government to actively promote the adoption of EVs in Sri Lanka. A gradual and sustainable phasing-out of ICE vehicles over the coming years is crucial. Such a transition not only aligns with the aspirations of the Sri Lankan population, providing affordable mobility for all, but also brings significant advantages to both the Government and the economy. It is imperative for policymakers to encourage and facilitate the increased influx of EVs, marking a transformative and environmentally responsible shift in the automotive landscape.(The writer is a Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Moratuwa and was the former Chairman of the Ceylon Electricity Board)

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/TbqFoZgFV3gNaO2V91uQ,19 Oct 2023 | BY Randeewa Malalasooriya,From tradition to transformation: SL's coconut export revolution,"In recent times, Sri Lanka has been rethinking its approach to exports in response to global economic changes. It's moving away from its traditional exports like tea and rubber, and exploring new avenues to make the most of its rich agricultural resources. A versatile resource Among the main agricultural exports, coconut is one such resource that has numerous opportunities. Coconuts, deeply ingrained in Sri Lanka's agricultural heritage, are now at the forefront of this transformation. These versatile fruits play a vital role, contributing approximately 12% to the nation's overall agricultural output. Abundance and demand The island nation boasts an annual coconut crop of 2.8-3.2 billion nuts, according to Coconut Research Institute statistics. Yet, this abundance falls short of the annual requirement of 4.6 billion nuts, a demand driven by domestic consumption, coconut oil production, and exports. Global recognitionOn the global stage, Sri Lanka has gained recognition in the coconut industry, primarily through products like desiccated coconut (DC) and brown fibre. The nation's DC stands out with its distinct white colour and exquisite taste, securing Sri Lanka's position as the fourth-largest exporter of kernel products worldwide. Additionally, Sri Lanka excels in brown fibre production – known for its exceptionally long and pristine strands – making it the world's leading exporter in this category, even finding applications in the brush industry. A global shiftHowever, the most remarkable aspect of this transformation is Sri Lanka's shift from traditional exports to innovative and value-added coconut products. This transition underscores not only adaptability, but also the immense potential that coconuts offer as a versatile and lucrative export commodity. In an era where global preferences are shifting towards healthier, plant-based alternatives, coconut-based products – especially coconut milk – are experiencing an unprecedented surge in demand. Embracing this transformative wave allows Sri Lanka to maximise its abundant coconut resources and align perfectly with the evolving tastes and desires of global consumers. Demand for coconut milk In such a backdrop, the potential for export revenue from coconut milk is staggering. Sri Lanka could tap into international markets hungry for this creamy delight. Beyond its renown in culinary applications, Sri Lankan coconut milk, extracted by pressing grated fresh coconut kernel, has garnered global demand. It is available in various forms, including undiluted and diluted liquid versions, as well as skimmed and spray-dried powder forms. Health-conscious consumers The production of coconut skimmed milk, obtained through centrifugal separation to remove fat, provides a high-quality protein source, ideal for various food products. This aligns with current global trends – such as vegan, gluten-free, and soy-free foods – contributing to the surge in popularity of coconut milk as a dairy milk substitute. Sri Lanka has capitalised on this opportunity by manufacturing and exporting a wide range of flavoured and unflavoured drinking coconut milk to the world. Sri Lankan coconut milk stands out in the world market due to its distinct white hue, unique aroma, and delectable flavor. Growth in earnings The demand for coconut milk, with its diverse culinary applications and growing popularity in global cuisines, is on the rise. Export earnings from coconut milk have steadily climbed, providing a ray of hope in an otherwise challenging economic landscape. Industrialisation Traditional methods of extracting coconut milk involve grating the coconut kernel and manually squeezing the fresh meat to yield the milk. However, this age-old practice results in significant economic loss, with only 30-40% of the coconut's potential value being realised compared to industrial methods. Comparing domestic and industrial milk extraction, the disparities become glaringly evident. While domestic usage recovers only 15-20% of the coconut's fat content, industrial methods boast a more efficient 30-35% recovery rate. The residue from domestic extraction often goes to waste, whereas in industrial settings, it's repurposed or sold. Even coconut water, shells, and parings – which are discarded domestically – find productive use in industrial applications like activated carbon production and oil production. Maximising resources Despite the shortfall of 1.4-1.6 billion coconuts, the nation still uses 1.8 billion coconuts domestically, primarily for culinary purposes. By reallocating a larger portion of this consumption for the production of industrial value-added products like coconut milk and coconut cream, Sri Lanka could harness its coconut resources more efficiently. Multifaceted benefits The benefits of such a shift are multifaceted. Factories could supply high-quality, safe, and value-added products for domestic consumption, often additive-free and organic, mitigating health concerns. Sri Lanka could also bolster its foreign exchange reserves through improved exports of coconut-based products. By reevaluating the role of coconuts in both its cultural and economic narrative, the nation can bridge the gap between abundance and scarcity, transforming its coconut resources into a source of prosperity and sustainability. Economic potential In 2019, Sri Lanka faced a local oil requirement of 140,000 metric tonnes (MT), with a substantial portion being imported, equivalent to a staggering 840 million kg of coconuts, or roughly 1.4 billion nuts. This substantial coconut resource was harnessed to produce 240 million kg of coconut milk, valued at $ 480 million (approximately Rs. 91.2 billion). This transformation from coconuts to coconut milk not only created a value addition of $ 126 million (around Rs. 24.5 billion) but also generated a net profit of Rs. 66.7 billion or $ 354 million. These statistics highlight the immense economic potential that Sri Lanka can unlock by maximising the use of its coconut resources, not only meeting local demands but also creating profitable opportunities through value addition. Innovative proposalsTo bolster Sri Lanka's economy through its coconut kernel industry, a groundbreaking proposal has emerged: the implementation of a value-based rebate certificate system. Under this proposal, manufacturers of coconut kernel-based products would be granted tax quotas of Rs. 50 for importing coconut oil, with the allocation determined by their contribution to exports. This allocation could be based on the foreign revenue they bring into the country or the volume they export. Efficient resource allocation Consider an example of a revenue-based quota system, where one kg of quota is granted for every $ 4 in foreign revenue generated. In this scenario, the total foreign exchange earnings from the coconut kernel industry amount to an impressive $ 350 million. Using the revenue-based quota system, this translates to an allocation of 87.5 million kg, equivalent to 87,500 MT of coconut oil to be imported. This imported oil would be sufficient for approximately 700 million coconuts. Solving the shortageFrom a cost perspective, the Government's investment in this system would be approximately Rs. 4,375 million (or $ 21.8 million). However, considering Sri Lanka's existing coconut shortage for both domestic consumption and industrial usage, this strategy presents an innovative solution. It would alleviate the coconut shortage predicament and allow for the allocation of more coconuts to produce value-added coconut kernel products, consequently boosting the country's foreign exchange reserves. Further economic gainsBy producing coconut milk from the 700 million allocated coconuts, this initiative could generate foreign revenue of $ 280 million. After deducting the initial Government cost of $ 21.8 million, the net gain for the country would amount to $ 258.2 million. Simultaneously, the importation of fresh coconuts would bolster local coconut supplies, stabilising prices for both farmers and consumers. A critical deficit The current expected foreign exchange revenue stands at an impressive $ 1.2 billion, with existing earnings from both kernel and non-kernel-based products at $ 400 million each. However, a critical $ 400 million deficit looms on the horizon. Safeguarding growers To bridge this gap and secure a brighter future for Sri Lanka, the nation envisions importing fresh coconuts. These coconuts will be the raw materials for producing high-demand products like coconut milk, virgin coconut oil, and DC. Each kilogram (kg) of coconut used in these processes promises significant foreign exchange gains, further enriching the nation's coffers. Preserving communities This visionary proposal doesn't just reflect economic ambition; it reflects a deep commitment to safeguarding local coconut growers. When coconut prices at the Colombo auction dip below the threshold of Rs. 65 per nut, imports can be judiciously curtailed. This safeguard is more than a mere economic manoeuvre; it's a lifeline for local growers, preserving their livelihoods and maintaining a fair minimum price for their produce. Improved income Foremost among these advantages is the assurance of stable and improved income. Historically, coconut growers have grappled with the unpredictability of local coconut prices, which often fluctuate due to market dynamics. However, with the increase in coconut exports, demand for coconuts will rise, leading to higher and more stable prices for their produce. This means that coconut growers can look forward to a reliable source of income that not only sustains their livelihoods but elevates their economic well-being. Regional lessonsCoconut exports in the region have been a significant driver of economic growth and stability for several countries, including Sri Lanka. Neighbouring nations such as Thailand and Indonesia have successfully leveraged their natural coconut resources to establish themselves as major players in the global coconut market. Thailand, for instance, has become a leading exporter of coconut products such as coconut milk, coconut water, and coconut oil. The country's coconut milk – known for its quality and taste – has gained popularity in international markets and is widely used in various cuisines. Thailand's success in coconut exports has contributed to its economic growth and stability. Indonesia, another regional powerhouse in coconut production, has also diversified its coconut exports. The country is a major exporter of products like coconut oil and desiccated coconut. Indonesia's coconut oil, in particular, is in high demand globally, with applications in food, cosmetics, and industrial sectors. These neighbouring countries have not only bolstered their economies through coconut exports, but have also made pragmatic choices like importing coconuts for domestic consumption. This strategic approach allows them to focus on producing high-value coconut-based products for the global market. Coconut exports in the region, led by countries like Thailand and Indonesia, have demonstrated the economic potential of coconut-based products in the global market. Sri Lanka is following suit by diversifying its coconut exports, aligning with contemporary consumer preferences and global trends, and aiming for economic growth and sustainability. Embracing adaptabilitySri Lanka, recognising the success of its regional counterparts, is also shifting its focus towards coconut-based exports, particularly coconut milk. This shift reflects a broader change in mindset, emphasising adaptability and pragmatism. By learning from its neighbours and maximising the potential of coconut exports, Sri Lanka aims to unlock a future where coconuts are not wasted but celebrated as a valuable export commodity. Tradition and sustainability Furthermore, the expansion of coconut exports safeguards the future of these farming communities. By creating a more lucrative market for coconuts, this initiative encourages the younger generation to embrace coconut farming as a viable profession. This not only preserves the traditional knowledge and practices of coconut cultivation but also injects fresh energy into the industry, ensuring its continuity for generations to come. The ripple effects of this growth extend beyond financial gains. With increased income and market stability, coconut growers can invest in the modernisation of their farms, adopting advanced farming techniques and technologies. This not only enhances productivity but also promotes sustainable and eco-friendly farming practices, aligning with global demands for responsible agriculture. Coconut milk’s potentialThese countries' success in coconut milk exports reflects the increasing popularity of coconut-based products, driven by global trends favouring healthier and plant-based food alternatives. As consumers worldwide continue to seek coconut milk for its culinary and health benefits, the region's coconut-producing nations are poised to play a crucial role in meeting this demand and expanding their export markets further. Coconut milk exports are not only economically beneficial but also align with the shift towards sustainable and plant-based food options, making them a significant part of the region's agricultural exports. Exporting coconut milk holds significant economic advantages for Sri Lanka. This strategic shift from traditional exports like tea and rubber diversifies the country's export portfolio, reducing reliance on a few commodities and spreading economic risk. The global demand for coconut milk is on the rise, thanks to its versatile use in various cuisines and as a dairy milk substitute, providing Sri Lanka with an opportunity to tap into a lucrative market. Moreover, processing coconut milk adds value to raw coconuts, enabling higher pricing and profit margins. This value addition contributes to increased revenue, strengthens foreign exchange reserves, and fosters job creation along the coconut milk production chain. Importantly, it stabilises coconut prices for farmers and consumers, ensuring fair returns for agricultural efforts. By adapting to global food trends favouring healthier and plant-based options, Sri Lanka's coconut milk exports not only boost the economy but also promote sustainability in the country's rich coconut industry. ConclusionSri Lanka's journey towards coconut-based exports, especially coconut milk, is a transformative and forward-thinking approach that capitalises on the nation's abundant coconut resources. It offers economic growth, stability, and sustainability while preserving the cultural and agricultural heritage of coconut farming.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/Apm2W9FhwMpzcbPmLebM,28 Mar 2023,Digital Marketplace to help Sri Lanka’s SMEs,"To expand the reach of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), including women-owned small businesses, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) is supporting the Commercial Bank of Ceylon (CBC) launch a digital marketplace in Sri Lanka, helping business owners connect with more customers locally and abroad. “Commercial Bank is extremely pleased to join hands with IFC to launch this pioneering digital marketplace “Commercial Bank Leap”. Building digital experiences around customers’ journeys is an ideal fit for the Bank, considering our committed focus on digitizing the banking landscape in Sri Lanka. We believe this will address the need gaps of enterprises including women led businesses and allow them to reach across broader levels in the global marketplace,” said CBC Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Sanath Manatunge.Named Commercial Bank LEAP, this one-of-its-kind initiative, which is supported under the Women in Work partnership between IFC and the Government of Australia, will open new market opportunities and build business connections all SMEs including women-owned SMEs, corporate and businesses creating an international marketplace to buy and sell products and raw materials. The platform will also assist businesses to digitize their core banking activities, provide business intelligence and will feature multiple sales channels. It will also provide access to CBC’s banking services including loan products, non-financial services and insurance.Of all SMEs in Sri Lanka, a quarter of which are owned or managed by women. Overall, SMEs account for around 45% of Sri Lanka’s formal employment. But the research shows lack of access to finance and business know-how holds many businesses in Sri Lanka, specifically women-owned, back from expanding their businesses beyond their informal micro-scale enterprises. “Sri Lanka’s macroeconomic crisis has had a negative and disproportionate impact on small businesses, particularly those owned by women, in their access to a wide range of customers and export revenue,” said IFC's Regional Portfolio Manager, Financial Institutions Group for South Asia Joon Young Park. “This is a timely and innovative initiative, offering a real avenue for small business owners to connect on a digital platform, access new financial products and grow their businesses, to help them not only survive but thrive, which will also positively impact the growth of Sri Lanka.” Widespread differences between men and women in digital and financial inclusion continue to hold back women entrepreneurs. In 2020, an IFC study assessing over 400 SMEs highlighted the significant gaps in Sri Lanka in terms of the uptake of digital business channels, with only a quarter of women-owned businesses trying a new digital channel, compared to one-third of male-owned businesses. “Even though there are many women-owned SMEs in Sri Lanka, a lot of them have limited access to markets, finances and business processes. This makes doing business a challenge”, said Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Second Secretary Sophie Gordon. “It is wonderful that Australia has been able to support CBC to develop a platform where women-owned SMEs can access digital banking products such as loans, non-financial services and insurance in one place. We hope this will facilitate access to new markets for more small businesses owned by women.”Under this initiative, Globalinker has been selected as the platform provider for the newly built digital marketplace, with the platform allowing SMEs to not only connect with others in the country but also abroad.

D. P. D. Jayathilake said: “The right to utilise the CBSL logo lies solely with the Director of the Communications Department of the CBSL. Therefore, utilising the CBSL logo in any mode without the prior approval of the Director of the Communications Department is a breach of intellectual property rights.”He added that at the moment the CBSL is exploring the possibility of securing a Brand Rights Protection from Facebook Inc as a measure to avoid such circumstances. When The Daily Morning inquired the CBSL officer on its stance in conducting any awareness measures that have been taken, he responded saying, “CBSL has conducted many public awareness campaigns through print and digital media platforms to raise the public's understanding of the ongoing scams.”Moreover, CBSL has conducted a live streamed session in the CBSL social media pages in this regard and various other illegal deposit taking institutions.In safeguarding one’s hard earned assets, the CBSL further urged the people to always verify the legitimacy of offers, products, or services before taking any action or making payments while not sharing personal or financial information such as NIC, debit/ credit cards, bank passbooks with unknown/ unseen individuals or entities as legitimate organisations will not ask for these information unsolicited. Meanwhile, the CBSL official requested the public to be cautious when dealing with suspicious or unknown emails, messages, hyperlinks, pop-up windows and to equip oneself with financial knowledge about apps, One Time Passwords (OTPs), Quick Response (QR) codes, debit/credit cards. Also,the CBSL informed the public to stick to secure and reputable payment methods when making transactions online while avoiding wire transfer or prepaid cards for unknown transactions.Moreover, “If you encounter a potential scam or are a victim of one, report it to the appropriate authorities, such as the FIU and Local Police,” the CBSL official stressed.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/qK4vFqujIorODlKovY05,30 Apr 2023,Reforms: The need of the hour,"Former Governor of Anambra State in Nigeria Peter Obi once wisely said: “No country can progress if its politics is more profitable than its industries. In a country where those in government are richer than the entrepreneurs, they manufacture poverty.” This is quite relevant to the Sri Lankan scenario. If so, we have been manufacturing poverty over the years and the key tool used for it by politicians is weak governance structures. Even if we apply the best economic policy in the world, it would mean nothing in a society without governance.The current reforms which are being discussed should also give equal weight to governance. Among the key reforms that have been discussed in Parliament, governance reforms should be given paramount importance. Suggested reforms related to the Central Bank, State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), social safety nets, and reforms on trade accounts are key components. Governance reforms and CBSL independenceIn the current set-up where the President is also the Finance Minister, there is a possibility of diluting governance structures. Both tasks are quite challenging and attempting to facilitate both will likely result in nothing, especially during an economic downturn. When reforming the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), in order to ensure its independence, appointment of positions should come through the Constitutional Council. Conversely, if the integrity of the Constitutional Council is diluted, the process of appointment of members to both the Monetary and Governance Boards of the Central Bank will not be channelled through proper checks and balances. This lack of governance structures in the CBSL leaves room for diluted appointments, particularly at a time when there is a need for a dynamic and credible Central Bank.Governance reforms for SOEs State-Owned Enterprise reforms require a governance structure with depth. At the moment, the SOE Restructuring Unit has called for proposals for transaction partners, but the selection of the partners should be managed with transparency. One way to ensure transparency is to avoid information asymmetry by providing access to information to potential interested partners of SOEs. Unsolicited proposals should be avoided and competitive bidding processes have to be adhered to. While we can consider privatisation of some entities, it is important that we implement governance structures for the remaining SOEs. Governance structures on procurement have to be in the forefront. In a nutshell, SOE reforms have to be driven by governance reforms. Otherwise, one bad transaction can drive public confidence down and lead Sri Lanka back to square one. Managing as well as reforming SOEs has provided a window of corruption for politicians. As Peter Obi said, one tool for politicians to become richer than the industries itself has been either to appoint their henchmen to maintain corruption, while sometimes they try to make profits when the reforms take place. Both have to be avoided and can only be minimised through governance reforms. Governance reforms for social safety nets Another set of key reforms which requires a deeper governance structure are the reforms related to social safety nets. It is no secret that the existing Samurdhi programme has been politically driven and poorly targeted. However, a new scheme has been gazetted and people have been asked to apply for the new social safety net. Ideally, the new selection has to be verified again through a third party organisation where political intervention is at a minimum. The selection of these third party organisations have to be made through a transparent procurement process. Otherwise, the same political biases on selecting the most vulnerable people will prevail. We have to keep in mind that every reform or every move provides a window for politicians to profit more than entrepreneurs. That is the very reason why we need to limit Government involvement and bring in governance structures. Only solid governance structures and people’s solidarity with governance structures can stop politics from becoming more profitable than industries.

Ltd., National Geographic Traveler, YouTube channel – Tamil Navigation, Instagram pages such as Malayali Yathrakal, dark angel, Surbhi – travel and lifestyle blogger, and Indian travel blogs such as Explore with Ecokats and lemonicks.com, etc. The media crew was divided into three groups to cover travel destinations in Sri Lanka pertaining to the island nation’s heritage, the Southern coast, and adventure. This was the first time a media delegation was made to report on separate sections on one tour and promote tourism in a more progressive way.In reporting heritage, they visited places such as the Ridi Viharaya, Minneriya, Anuradhapura, Mihintale, the Sigiriya Rock Fortress, the Dambulla Cave Temple, Polonnaruwa, spice gardens, the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens, the Temple of the Tooth Relic, the Giragama Tea Factory, Embekke Devalaya in Kandy, and the Negombo beaches as well as experiencing cultural dance performances. They were amazed at the magic and splendour these destinations had to offer and of the proud heritage which has been preserved for many years. The group covering the Southern belt of Sri Lanka had the opportunity of visiting the Yala National Park, Hambantota, Galle, and Mirissa. They were also able to visit the Kanneliya Rain Forest, the Lunuganga Estate, the Dutch Fort – Galle, and engage in whale watching at Mirissa. The Lunuganga Estate was a favourite among the visitors as this was the country house of renowned Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa. En route, the media personnel visited the Kande Vihara, where the 160 feet-tall Buddha statue is believed to be one of the tallest in the world. Another attraction was the whale and dolphin watching experience in Mirissa, where they were able to see various species of whales and dolphins performing acrobatics in the warm Indian ocean.The third group went on an adventure trail as they covered areas including locations such as Kandy, Horton Plains – Nuwara Eliya, Ella, Bentota, etc. They visited the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens, the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, and the Hantana Mountain range, which is a popular adventure hub for those who would be interested in hiking, camping, and bird watching and enjoying a spectacular view of the Kandy City. All these specific locations offered a plethora of content for the media group to deliver through their respective media houses and platforms. The group travelled to Horton Plains in the early hours of the day, the only national park situated in the hill country, which is Sri Lanka’s highest and most isolated plateau at an elevation of more than 2000 m located in the Nuwara Eliya District. After an evening walk in Nuwara Eliya City, they proceeded to Ella by train and finally to Bentota, which saw the conclusion of the tour.This media FAM tour is considered an exclusive opportunity to promote Sri Lanka as a tourist destination among Indian travellers and encourage more Indian tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka, especially as both countries share similar historical and cultural aspects, traditions, and religious sites. It will also be an opportunity to convey a positive message that Sri Lanka is safe for visitors and travellers. As per reports, India has recorded the highest number of tourist arrivals to the country this year.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/DtMGMvdkrBcQ805AvDgL,03 Dec 2023 | By Dimuthu Jayasinghe,Transforming ideas into tangible consumer realities with R&D,"Research and Development (R&D) has become a pivotal function since progressive organisations have realised the importance of creating a sustainable value differential versus competitor offerings. Market leadership is a widespread ambition, with R&D being applied to create a competitive advantage. In the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) market, the first-mover advantage is ever more important to widen the presence with distinct offerings catering to various consumer needs. R&D plays a critical role in identifying consumer needs through prototyping and experimenting with new ideas, blending technical expertise and creativity to cater to those needs. Not all consumer insights are directly transferable to product formats, however. The R&D function is entrusted to successfully deliver consumer benefits at an affordable cost and utility via the product format. This may very well be the biggest challenge which R&D scientists face daily, specifically in the FMCG industry. The demand for variety and uniqueness is a formidable task as consumers are exposed to global products and markets through easy access to ecommerce. Furthermore, local companies have a substantial challenge in combating global giants, and with liberalisation of trade practices, the first to be in the market with a novel proposition becomes essential.The above challenges can be tackled with confidence as many companies are opting to invest in R&D to create unique propositions with a faster turnaround time. The necessary infrastructure, technical skills, and an entrepreneurial mindset serve as the vital formula for success. The fear of failure is something many R&D professionals have to circumvent with the right level of precision in the design of products. This requires investing in R&D talent and acquiring the necessary technical skills through open innovation routes as necessary. Streamlining internal processes, promoting many ideas as part of the R&D strategy, and the willingness to experiment with those ideas lend a multitude of learning to the business in channelling efforts to better target consumer needs. R&D professionals need to engage closely with brand building teams as a fundamental part of their role. Partnering the brand team and gearing the brand for success with the elements of product functionality, cost, distinctiveness, and aesthetic appeal will be important foundations which cannot be compromised. R&D is no longer a silo restricted to a laboratory, but rather morphed into a collaborative endeavour, as it is prudent to engage across the organisation’s value chain and directly link with consumers. This enables R&D to envisage and design the correct product features with a higher probability of success in the market. Many organisations, including Hemas Manufacturing, have started to define R&D strategies across their business plans as a testament to the value addition the function provides. While R&D remains to be a cost centre, it must be viewed as an investment which bolsters the organisation towards sustainable and substantial growth.As product portfolios become more globalised, with divergent consumer segments demanding faster solutions, it is essential to be abreast of the latest trends. Capturing those mega trends early and localising them is an essential role for R&D to design futuristic offerings. Whether it is a fad or reality, R&D will need to focus on possible options even to the level of mass customising products. Recognising futuristic trends or catering to tactical situations will remain under R&D purview, helping growth in the top and bottom lines of the business. For example, designing products which have specific functional benefits, designing packaging to reduce the environmental impact, or designing value for money offerings during economic turbulence will all need to have an R&D input as the starting point. The R&D function, especially in FMCG companies, has evolved to become a key contributor for business growth. The future holds many possibilities with R&D taking the lead to grow product portfolios exponentially as businesses place trust in the function to deliver authentic recipes for success. A simple mantra for R&D is to ‘experiment constantly and innovate entrepreneurially,’ which would serve as the fundamental guideline for any R&D professional’s route to success. (The writer is Director – Research and Development at Hemas Manufacturing [Pvt] Ltd.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/bngSHlPq19CPEk9nvIjz,04 Apr 2023,Richard Branson's rocket firm files for bankruptcy,"British billionaire Sir Richard Branson's rocket company Virgin Orbit has filed for bankruptcy in the US after failing to secure new investment.The satellite launch company halted operations weeks ago but it hopes to find a buyer for the business.The company, based in California, announced last week that it would cut 85% of its 750-strong workforce.Earlier this year, a Virgin Orbit rocket failed to complete its first-ever satellite launch from UK soil.Virgin Orbit's boss Dan Hart said that although the company had “taken great efforts” to address its finances and secure more funding, “we ultimately must do what is best for the business.”He said that Virgin Orbit will now concentrate on finding a buyer for the business “to provide clarity on the future of the company to its customers, vendors, and employees”.Virgin Orbit was founded in 2017 and is a spin-off from Sir Richard's space tourism company Virgin Galactic.It launches rockets from beneath modified Boeing 747 planes to send satellites into space.But in January, an attempt to send a satellite into orbit from the UK for the first time failed because a rocket fuel filter had become dislodged, causing one of the engines to overheat.The mission had been billed as a milestone for UK space exploration.It was hoped it would mark a major step in helping to turn the country into a global player – from manufacturing satellites to building rockets and creating new spaceports.Virgin Orbit, which is mostly owned by Virgin Group, scrambled to find new funding following the UK rocket failure and paused operations last month to conserve cash.The company, which listed its shares on New York's Nasdaq index in 2021, had debts of $ 153.5 million as of September last year.On Tuesday, the company said one of its sister companies – Virgin Investments – would provide $ 31.6 million in new money to help Virgin Orbit through the process of finding a buyer.It has filed for what is known as Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US. This allows a business to keep operating and address its financial issues while providing protection against creditors who are owed money.This is not the end for Virgin Orbit. Quite a few space companies have gone through Chapter 11, only to re-emerge a few months later with new owners, no debts and a healthy stash of investment cash to take the business forward. You need look no further than London-based OneWeb, which has just now managed to complete its broadband internet constellation in the sky.But who will step forward to buy a rocket business? There are tens if not hundreds of similar enterprises across the world developing small launch vehicles.If Sir Richard Branson's company can claim one key separator, it ought to be responsiveness – the ability with its jumbo jet platform to launch from anywhere at short notice. This has appeal to the military, for example. Except, the firm has found it very hard to do, launching only twice last year.Any prospective new owner, therefore, will want to know a high cadence of launches can be achieved. This means going up every month, the original aim of the company.Hart said despite the financial problems, he was confident the company had a “wide appeal” to a new owner because its team had created “cutting edge launch technology”.But Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at investment firm AJ Bell, said the company's failed launch mission from the UK was ""not the best advert"" for its technology.“Neither is Virgin Orbit's collapse the best advert for the space investment theme,” she added.“This industry may have significant potential at some point in the unknown future but investors tempted to reach for the stars have only had their fingers burned so far.”Sir Richard is one of a very small group of billionaires who have expanded their business empires into launching satellites and attempting to pioneer commercial space travel.The others include Jeff Bezos, founder of online retailer Amazon who set up his space company, Blue Origin, as well as Twitter and Tesla owner Elon Musk, who founded SpaceX.Sir Richard and Virgin Group have invested more than $1 billion in the business in a quest to launch satellites through Virgin Orbit but also to develop reusable ‘space planes” to take tourists on brief trips to suborbital space.Virgin Galactic has already started selling tickets for $ 250,000 for these journeys and celebrities such as pop star Justin Bieber have signed up.But the main players in the “billionaire space race” have also faced criticism for what some see as offering joy rides for the super-wealthy at a time when countries across the globe are being impacted by climate change.However, Bezos has insisted his space exploration is partly an environmental mission to “to take all heavy industry, all polluting industry and move it into space, and keep Earth as this beautiful gem of a planet that it is”, he previously said.(BBC)

GDP is about 25% below its pre-pandemic trend and downside risks to the outlook remain high,” Oxford Economics said.Moreover, it said that meeting the terms of the IMF programme, especially governance reforms and fiscal consolidation will be challenging while the presidential election planned in the fourth quarter of 2024 also raises risks from the political side.However, it said that economic stabilisation appears to be increasingly flowing through to a pick-up in economic activity as tourism continues to rebound and buoy services activity while easing shortages and renewed confidence help to attract back dissuaded travellers. It also added that while still weak in Q4 of 2023, PMIs suggest the manufacturing and construction sectors started improving in recent months, likely due to an increase in firms' ability and willingness to produce and invest.Oxford Economics expects Sri Lanka’s GDP to reach the pre-pandemic level by 2025 and expects 1.5% economic growth in 2024.It said that a debt restructuring deal was struck with official creditors late last year, talks with private creditors are ongoing and support from the IMF and other multilateral institutions should continue, with a staff-level agreement on the second review of the IMF support package successfully reached on March 20. “Reserves have been rebuilt and the currency has appreciated, signifying a lower risk premium,” Oxford Economics said.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/4nuNE4sB2ZNePerKn8Qb,20 Dec 2023,Bank of Japan keeps ultra-loose policy,"The Bank of Japan maintained ultra-loose policy settings on Tuesday (19) in a widely expected move, as the bank opted to await more evidence on whether wages and prices would rise enough to justify a shift away from massive monetary stimulus.The central bank also made no change to its dovish policy guidance, dashing hopes among some traders it would tweak the language to signal a near-term end to negative interest rates.Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda said prices and wages appeared to be moving in the right direction with labour unions and big firms signalling the chance of sustained wage gains next year. But he warned conditions remained uncertain.“The chance of trend inflation accelerating towards our price target is gradually heightening,” Ueda said in a press conference after the meeting. “But we still need to scrutinise whether a positive wage-inflation cycle will fall in place.”At the two-day meeting that ended on Tuesday, the BOJ kept its short-term rate target at -0.1% and that for the 10-year government bond yield around 0%. It also left unchanged a pledge to ramp up stimulus “without hesitation” if needed.The yen tumbled and Japanese stocks gained after the BOJ’s decision to hold off on phasing out stimulus.Japan has seen inflation hold above 2% for over a year and some firms have signalled their readiness to keep raising wages, increasing the chance the BOJ will finally abandon its status as a dovish outlier among global central banks.More than 80% of economists polled by Reuters in November expect the BOJ to end its negative rate policy next year with half of them predicting April as the most likely timing. Some see the chance of a policy shift in January.Ueda gave no clear signal on how soon the BOJ could exit negative rates, but said there “won’t be much data coming in” between now and the next policy meeting in January 2022-2023.He also said the BOJ won’t rush into raising rates just because the U.S. Federal Reserve could start cutting them soon.“Obviously, I am always thinking about various scenarios about how we could change policy when certain conditions fall into place,” Ueda said.“But uncertainty over the outlook is extremely high and we have yet to foresee inflation sustainably and stably achieving our target. As such, it’s hard to show now with a high degree of certainty how we can exit.”Since taking the helm in April, Ueda has moved towards dismantling the radical stimulus of his predecessor by relaxing the bank’s grip on long-term rates in July and October. Markets see the next step to be a hike in short-term rates to around zero from the current -0.1%.Some analysts warn that consumption, which is already softening, could worsen further next year if wages do not rise enough to cushion the blow from rising inflation.But the BOJ maintained its view that consumption continues to increase moderately, underscoring its conviction the economy is on track for a recovery.While inflation-adjusted real wages continue to fall, Ueda said that alone won’t be an impediment to normalise ultra-easy policy if the BOJ can foresee real wages turning positive.“The prospects for (sustainably achieving our price target) are gradually heightening. But in terms of whether the threshold would be met, we’d prefer to look at more data,” he said.Analysts say the BOJ may find it easier to move in months like January and April, when it releases a quarterly outlook report with fresh growth and price projections.But sharp shifts in global monetary policy may complicate the BOJ’s decision with U.S. and European central banks signalling that they are done hiking rates.Raising rates at a time other central banks are cutting them could trigger a spike in the yen that hurts big manufacturers’ profits and discourages them from hiking wages, analysts say.“While mentioning how Japan is moving closer to achieving the price target, Ueda probably wants to retain a free hand on the timing of an exit,” said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.Moody’s Analytics Senior Economist Stefan Angrick expects the BOJ to drop negative interest rate policy in April, around when early results for the spring wage negotiations come in.“That said, it’s hard to see the BOJ lifting rates much further than 0%,” Angrick said. “The weak state of the economy, the appreciating yen, decelerating inflation, and global central banks getting ready to cut rates suggest further hikes are not in the cards.” (Reuters)

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/cY8zgykiQd4IRtA1WQHp,08 Sep 2023 | By Supantha Mukherjee and Martin Coulter,Big Tech's core businesses face overhaul under EU tech rules,"The European Union (EU) has picked out 22 so-called ""gatekeeper"" services, run by six of the biggest tech companies in the world, to face new rules as part of its latest crackdown on Big Tech.The wide-ranging Digital Markets Act (DMA) will apply to services from Alphabet, Amazon , Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and TikTok owner ByteDance.Seen by many as a companion piece of legislation to the Digital Services Act (DSA), which imposes greater responsibilities on tech companies for the content shared on their sites, the DMA has been designed to level the playing field between Big Tech companies and smaller competitors.The tech giants now have six months to comply with the provisions of the DMA, which aims to improve access and the compatibility of services in Europe, and poses an unprecedented challenge to these companies' business models.Under the DMA, companies with more than 45 million monthly active users and a market capitalisation of € 75 billion ($ 82 billion) are considered gatekeepers providing a core platform service.Businesses labelled as such will be required to make their messaging apps interoperate with rivals and let users decide which apps to pre-install on their devices.Alphabet's Google had the highest number of services, including its Android operating system, Maps, and Search, which would face tougher rules. Meta's Facebook, Instagram, Marketplace, and WhatsApp also qualified as gatekeepers.Companies that fail to comply with their obligations can be fined up to 10% of their annual global turnover for DMA violations.Gatekeepers could ask for an interim measure to suspend the application of the rules but they would need to launch a legal case in the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg to do that, a senior EU Commission official said. ""We haven't seen anything like that so far.""Following the introduction of separate legislation, the Digital Services Act, Zalando took the Commission to court in June.""It's D-Day for #DMA!"" EU industry chief Thierry Breton said on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""The most impactful online companies will now have to play by our EU rules.""Mixed reactionsA Microsoft spokesperson said it accepts its gatekeeper designation, while Meta, Google, and Amazon spokespersons said they were reviewing the designations.Apple and TikTok were less welcoming.TikTok said it ""fundamentally disagreed with this decision"" and was ""disappointed that no market investigation was conducted prior to this decision"", adding it was considering its next steps.An Apple spokesperson said the company remained ""very concerned about the privacy and data security risks the DMA poses for our users"".The iPhone maker had earlier raised concerns that the DMA would lead to more installing of apps that do not come via Apple's App Store, or ""side-loading"".""The Commission should balance the need to protect user security and privacy with the very real risk that gatekeeper app stores will use security and privacy as excuses to dilute compliance with their DMA obligations,"" said Stavroula Vryna, partner at law firm Clifford Chance.Alphabet's Gmail, Microsoft's Outlook, and Samsung's browser were exempted after the companies provided sufficiently justified arguments showing that these services do not qualify as gatekeepers, the Commission said.The Commission has also opened four market investigations to further assess Microsoft's and Apple's submissions that some of their core platforms such as Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising, and Apple's iMessage services do not qualify as gateways.""iMessage is designed and marketed for personal consumer communications, and we look forward to explaining to the commission why iMessage is outside the scope of the DMA,"" an Apple spokesperson said.(Reuters)

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/fYX6W7gIaq6fRF0Cav6X,13 Jun 2023,National policy to be set up for gem and jewellery,"A national policy is to be formulated with the consensus of all stakeholders of Sri Lanka's gems and jewellery industry. During the recently held meeting by the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources and Sustainable Development, chaired by MP Ajith Mannapperuma instructed the authorities to take the next steps to prepare a national policy with the consensus of all stakeholders of Sri Lanka's gems and jewellery.  The meeting was held in order to discuss issues faced by the gem and jewellery industry in Sri Lanka with the participation of representatives from gem and jewellery business associations and during the meeting a proposal related to a national policy prepared by a business association was presented to the committee.The representatives also pointed out the facts about the difficulties in obtaining permits for gem mining. The committee emphasised that the process can be made efficient by issuing licences jointly to all relevant agencies and for the issuance of licences dedicate at least one day a week at the regional office of the Gems and Jewellery Authority.Sajith Premadasa, the Leader of the Opposition, who participated in this meeting, stated that the problems in this sector could be classified under the following sectors: gem mining, gem cutting, polishing, and value adding, trade activities including import and export, trade promotion, etc. Premadasa further mentioned that a report should be prepared and brought to the attention of the Gem and Jewellery Authority, Ministry of Finance, and relevant institutions.Meanwhile, the representatives of the aforesaid industry pointed out that due to the ban on the import of gold, the business community involved in the jewellery manufacturing industry, depending on the tourism sector, is currently suffering. It was also revealed that these business communities who deal only in foreign currency bring a huge amount of foreign exchange to the country and proposed to use a part of that foreign exchange they earn and allow them to import gold for the business. It was also stated that due to the taxes imposed by the government on the industry, the businessmen are suffering.Accordingly, the chairman of the committee said that the attention of the Ministry of Finance will be given to these matters immediately. The decrease in the number of workers entering the gem and jewellery industry was also discussed. The MPs and the representatives present pointed out the need to establish training institutes in the areas where this industry is based and take steps to popularise this sector.The use of new technology, issues arising in export, tax issues etc. were also discussed in the committee. Accordingly, the problems presented in this committee will be prepared as a report and steps will be taken to find solutions to them after discussions with the responsible institutions, the chairman of the committee said.Leader of the opposition Sajith Premadasa, committee members Akila Ellawala, Waruna Liyanage, Nalaka Bandara Kottegoda and Dr. Thilak Rajapaksa and Member of Parliament Chandima Weerakkodi also participated in this committee meeting.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/SP16HAckYNK4E5ZejMTT,26 Feb 2023,Why it takes so long to recover from an economic crisis,"I have been reflecting on the last few years of public policy and discussion, which I can broadly divide into three main chapters:Chapter 1 – Denial Chapter 2 – Realisation Chapter 3 - RecoveryChapter 1 – Denial There was a time when even respected businessmen thought an economic crisis was a distant scenario. Many politicians, across all party lines, failed to consider a situation of 12-hour power cuts and long fuel lines, and viewed debt restructuring and accessing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as taboo conversations. We relied on a $ 3.6 billion bailout from an unknown Omani fund and thought China and the Port City would bail us out as a last resort. Some even thought the discovery of a sapphire cluster might be the breakthrough Sri Lanka needed. Sri Lankans believed we were a special nation with a magical power that would rescue us in some other way. Despite our strategic location, beautiful weather, and natural beauty being undeniable assets, they do not guarantee a rescue from our own bad policies. Our denial was so strong that an international institution titled their report on the Sri Lankan economy as ‘Denial is Not a Strategy’.Chapter 2 – Realisation The moment of truth came, but we were too late to respond. None of our bailout expectations materialised and the international financial architecture found it difficult to save us. Our debt is unsustainable and the IMF requires a commitment from our creditors before providing us financial assistance. We are struggling due to global geopolitics and our poor diplomatic service and lack of professionalism doesn’t allow us to be taken seriously. We hurt all our friendly nations as well as India, China, Japan, and the US. Islamic countries too were concerned and unhappy with us over different issues. People only realised the depth of the crisis when medicine was in short supply and their loved ones considered leaving the country. Inflation skyrocketed, prices increased, and poverty affected about 30% of the population.Chapter 3 – RecoveryThe moment people realised the severity of the crisis, they started asking about when we would recover. The simple answer is that it takes a long time and now many of us understand why. Overcoming a crisis of this scale, which in itself is a combination of multiple crises, cannot be done easily. Simultaneously, we face a balance of payment crisis, a debt crisis, a financial crisis, a humanitarian crisis, and a political crisis. The cost of delaying a response to the crisis and mismanagement has to be shared by us all, with mounting tax increases and high inflation pressure from the grassroots. As a result, we can see constant protests and interruptions to public life, further worsening the situation. At the same time, this opens a new political space where any political party can make unrealistic promises and auction for votes. This vicious cycle is why recovery from the economic crisis takes a long time.The specifics of debt restructuring are still a mystery to us. We don’t know how the restructuring will be carried out or the impact it will have on the banking industry. It is also unclear how the markets will respond. Without domestic debt restructuring, even if we apply a 50% haircut on International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) and Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs), our debt to GDP ratio after 10 years will be 136%, according to a Verité Research study published in October 2022. Cost of servicing new debt and the cost of rolling over previous debt at a high yield curve will not bring down our debt to GDP ratio. Nevertheless, it is still possible for domestic debt to be restructured and banking recapitalisation is necessary. According to the same document, investments in Government securities, primarily Treasury bills and Treasury bonds, account for more than 30% of the interest revenue for the total banking industry. Hence, changing the interest rates on these securities will affect the stability of banks. On the other hand, 82% of the money in the EPF and ETF has been put into Government securities.As the required changes take place, no one will be happy, so people and opinion leaders will react in different ways. The changes will go back and forth and recovery will be prolonged. Elections will come and decision-making authorities will change and policy decisions will also go back and forth. All this is why it takes so long to recover from an economic crisis.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/9GVkseWeyGHnJiUKELRA,01 Nov 2023,Marginal increase in Colombo’s inflation in Oct.,"The overall rate of inflation as measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis has increased to 1.5% in October this year from 1.3% in September 2023.In its latest report, the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) said the y-o-y inflation of the food group remained unchanged at -5.2% in October and September. Meanwhile, the y-o-y inflation non-food group increased to 4.9% in October from 4.7% in September.For the month of October 2023, the contribution to inflation by food commodities was -1.76%, while the contribution of non-food items was 3.25%. The DCS said this was mainly due to the increase in value change in the groups of housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, education, clothing and footwear, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and narcotic, recreation and culture, health, miscellaneous goods and services, and communication.A decrease in value change was reported for the groups of furnishing household equipment and routine household maintenance, restaurants and hotels, and transport, the DCS said further.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/naAMbV52eGZwm7NLDXMl,27 Oct 2023,CSE launches RSS through SBL,"The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) announced, in a press release, a development in the Sri Lankan stock market with the launch of regulated short selling (RSS) through stock borrowing and lending (SBL), with effect from 6 November.The initiative aims to promote market efficiency, liquidity, and investor confidence while fostering economic growth aligning with international standards and practices.SBL, an initiative by the CSE, connects lenders and borrowers of shares for a predetermined period, allowing them to capitalise on market trends as in prevailing interest rates.However, only eligible securities specified by the CSE will be allowed for SBL transactions and the eligibility of these securities will be reviewed by the CSE on a quarterly basis. All investors who maintain Central Depository System (CDS) accounts will now have the privilege of engaging in SBL transactions as lenders and borrowers via the CDS through their respective trading participants and custodian banks (CDS participants), the CSE said.  “CDS participants are empowered to act as intermediaries for SBL transactions. Investors can seamlessly carry out SBL transactions by submitting the lending/borrowing orders using the participant pool account, or by submitting orders directly to the CDS through their participants,” the CSE explained. For lenders, SBL offers a unique opportunity to leverage a portion of their portfolio that may not be actively used for regular trading, while simultaneously earning an additional fee-based income. On the other hand, borrowers can leverage the potential of price movements in a declining market, amplifying their gains.Investors can take advantage of this opportunity by establishing a SBL agreement with the relevant lending or borrowing participant.The CSE is also introducing RSS with checks and balances designed to address risk management and market stability in the short-selling practices. Only the shares of specific listed companies meeting liquidity criteria will be eligible for RSS.Further, RSS can only be carried out through the Automated Trading System (ATS), using the services of a trading participant. RSS will not be permitted for orders submitted by clients via the Internet.  A key feature of RSS is the uptick rule, which will come into effect when the price of a share eligible for RSS declines by 10% from its previous closing price. In such instances, the system will validate short sale orders based on the rule. Under the uptick rule, a short sell order must be at least one tick size above the last traded price of the share, ensuring that short sales are executed at a price higher than the most recent trade. The uptick rule prevents short selling at excessively low prices, reducing potential market manipulation and volatility.If a share's price depreciates by 20%, RSS for that particular share will not be permitted until the price appreciates above the designated threshold.Commenting on the initiative, CSE Chairman Dilshan Wirasekara stated: “The introduction of regulated short selling through stock borrowing and lending is a testament to our commitment to fostering a dynamic and resilient financial market ecosystem here in Sri Lanka. This new initiative not only enhances our market's attractiveness to both local and international investors but also reinforces our position as a progressive exchange.”

With critical economic factors such as interest rate, exchange rate and inflation stabilized, there is greater certainty and confidence in doing business. The timely finalization of the Domestic Debt Optimization is noteworthy and we expect expedited finalization of the international debt structuring too, which will further enhance internal conditions and also the external profile of Sri Lanka. We have recalibrated our strategy in the current context and remain well on track in achieving our targets which will deliver continued value to our stakeholders.”Profit after tax at the Group level was Rs. 5.4 billion whilst the same at the Bank level was Rs. 5.2 billion which compared with Rs. 691 million and Rs. 561 million respectively of the nine months of 2022 (YoY). Healthy performance on revenue, reduction in impairment provisions compared to the comparative period and effective cost management across all operations enabled enhanced profitability. At the Bank level Gross income for the period was Rs. 102.9 billion, up by 38% YoY. Net interest income (NII) was Rs. 24.4 billion, an increase of 10%. Interest income of Rs. 93.7 billion which increased by 44% and interest expense of Rs. 69.3 billion which increased by 61% drove NII. As market interest rates continued to decline, in response to Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s relaxing monetary policy, the Bank passed on the benefit to customers with reduced loan rates. The deposits book was also re-priced simultaneously, with the Bank achieving a NIM of 4.00%. Net fee and commission income also drove profitability with a marked improvement of 24% to Rs. 5.4 billion. The Bank’s concerted transaction drive with a wider objective of supporting the economy as it regains momentum, particularly on trade related services enabled enhanced fee income amidst moderate loan book expansion. Other non-fund based income categories of net gains from trading, net gains from financial assets at fair value through profit and loss and net gains on derecognition of financial assets all increased exponentially, on account of variation in the exchange rate and interest rates compared to the nine months in the prior year. Impairment charges for the nine months ended 30 September 2023 were Rs. 13.9 billion, a YoY reduction of 37%, primarily due to higher impairment provisions made for FCY Investments in the same period of 2022. Adopting a prudent basis, the impairment charge for loans and advances increased over the corresponding period, given the economic conditions.  NDB continued to maintain provisions on investments in foreign currency bonds, for the expected International Sovereign Bond (ISB) restructuring to be announced by the Government of Sri Lanka during the year. The Impairment cover (Stage 3) to Stage 3 Loans Ratio was 36.57% (2022: 37.44%) whilst the Impaired Loans (Stage 3) Ratio was 9.18% (2022: 6.24%) by end September 2023, reflecting the industry-wide concerns on credit quality. Total operating costs for the period was Rs. 10.1 billion, up by 20%. General increase in price levels, particularly energy and foreign currency denominated expenses drove costs up. The resultant cost to income ratio was 30.2% and compared well within the industry. Taxes netted Rs.4.3 billion, comprising taxes on financial services of Rs. 2.4 billion and income tax of Rs. 1.9 billion.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/MbV0GCtBvEAqwawzifxf,24 Sep 2023 | By Shenal Fernando,Shocking revelations at Supreme Court: Did Cabraal alter GR’s letter to IMF?,"Monetary Board member alleges initial letter by Gotabaya calls for ‘fund-assisted programme’Claims Cabraal tinkered with pre-default letter, removed phrase and sent mixed signalsAccuses Cabraal of sending ‘mixed signals’ to IMF, delaying economic recoveryShocking revelations have been made before the Supreme Court against former Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Ajith Nivard Cabraal, wherein he has been accused of unilaterally amending a letter dated 18 March 2022 sent to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), from one clearly seeking a “fund-assisted programme” into one which was described as being tentative and non-committal, further delaying Sri Lanka’s economic recovery with the assistance of the IMF. These allegations were revealed when submissions were made before the Supreme Court in the two Fundamental Rights applications bearing numbers SC FR 195/2022 and SC FR 212/2022, seeking accountability from the Rajapaksas and other leading bureaucrats of the former regime for the current economic crisis. Making submissions before the Supreme Court, Monetary Board member Sanjeewa Jayawardena, PC alleged that the letter sent on 18 March 2022 by former President Gotabaya Rajapaska to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, originally drafted by then Deputy Governor of the CBSL K.M. Mahinda Siriwardana, had set out in clear and plain language that Sri Lanka was seeking a “fund-assisted programme”.However, elaborating further, he revealed that the final draft that had been sent to the former President had been deliberately tinkered with and revised, distorting the original intention of the letter, and that the final letter sent to the IMF had merely sought to “formally commence consultations with the IMF to agree on the way forward to facilitate growth stability to address the broad macroeconomic issues confronted by the country amidst the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the other global challenges”. He revealed that the IMF had found the letter both non-committal and tentative. In his submissions before court, Jayawardena alleged that the amendments to the letter dated 18 March 2022 had been made by former Governor of the CBSL Ajith Nivard Cabraal.He pointed out that the letter dated 18 March 2022 had sent mixed signals to the IMF and had indicated Sri Lanka’s lack of commitment towards an IMF programme.The two aforementioned letters have been filed before the Supreme Court.According to the submissions made before the Supreme Court, it has been alleged that the former officials of the Rajapaksa regime including Cabraal had created what was described as a ‘Chinese wall’ around the former President and had concealed from him the true condition of the economy. Until the end, the former President had been under the assumption that the Monetary Board had unanimously been against approaching the IMF.However, speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, Cabraal stated that the President had written to the IMF Managing Director seeking an “IMF engagement in Sri Lanka” on 18 March 2022 and that the IMF Managing Director had written back to the President on 28 March 2022, stating that the IMF understood that the “Government is actively considering an IMF-supported programme”.  Commenting on the allegations that he had unilaterally amended the letter sent to the former President, Cabraal said: “If your copywriter sends you a note and you adjust it and if someone asks you if it’s an error, what will you say? It’s the authority who sends the letter who has to be comfortable with the letter. “If the President finally signs the letter, it means that the President is comfortable with it. He is not going to ask whether the copywriter wrote it or whether the sub-editor wrote it or if the editor wrote it. These are all semantics which people are trying to twist and turn.” He further stated: “Since the matter is before the Supreme Court, please refer to my initial affidavits filed in the Supreme Court dated 15 July 2022, the subsequent affidavit dated 22 May 2023, and a further affidavit dated 12 July 2023.”However, The Sunday Morning Business was unable to obtain access to these affidavits.In the joint affidavit dated 24 July 2023 filed by Jayawardena and Dr. Ranee Jayamaha, it was expressly provided that the response letter issued by the IMF in relation to the letter dated 18 March 2022 “very carefully, eminently demonstrates the clear understanding of the IMF, that what was being requested was a sub-optimal engagement only”.This issue with regard to the amendment of the draft letter sent to the former President was dealt with in detail in Jayawardena and Jayamaha’s (32B Respondent) joint affidavit dated 4 August 2023 as follows: “A) With regard to the matter of the 32B Respondent, at his one on one meeting with the then President, at the intervention of several parliamentarians, being able to persuade the then President to agree to an unqualified IMF fund-assisted programme, with an EFF (as had been already adverted to in the two previous affidavits of these respondents and in this affidavit as well), given that the IMF had found the previous letter of the President dated 18 March 2022, to the IMF MD, to be both non-committal and tentative. “B) These respondents state that the wording of the said letter is at best ambiguous and on a plain meaning thereof, shows to an informed reader, a total lack of commitment of Sri Lanka to at least at this juncture, engage in addressing its historically evolving deep-rooted structural dysfunction. “C) This is why the 32B Respondent had to prevail upon the then President to immediately issue an official written communication under his hand and on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL), an official communication, in the clearest and most unequivocal form, conveying both the Head of State’s and the GoSL’s country commitment, for a full IMF fund-assisted programme, and to cure the defects in the letter, which tainted and vitiated the first letter of 18 March 2022. “D) The agreement of the President to this proposal led to the 32B Respondent as already stated, drafting on his request, the unqualified request for an IMF programme, which was transmitted by the 32B Respondent by email, to the Presidential Secretariat on the 7 April 2022, and which was duly signed on the official letterhead of the President on that night itself and which was thereafter formally handed over by the 32B Respondent to the new Governor Dr. Weerasinghe, on his first day in office, being 8 April 2022, and which the Governor duly transmitted to the IMF. “E) It now transpires, upon the persistent inquiries made in order to draft this counter affidavit, that Mr. Siriwardana, who was then the senior-most Deputy Governor of the CBSL, had in March 2022, drafted an appropriate letter, seeking a ‘fund-assisted programme,’ in clear and plain language, to be forwarded by the CBSL, to the President (given that immense pressure had been mounting from all quarters, including internationally, on the GoSL, to finally relent for an IMF programme and to seek and have a credible anchor of the IMF as the international lender of last resort and that the Government was finally showing signs of relenting). “F) But most tragically, this draft letter of Mr. Siriwardana had been deliberately tinkered with and revised, thereby distorting Mr. Siriwardana’s draft and completely overriding the same. “G) This draft which had been finally sent from the highest administrative level above Mr. Siriwardana, in this distorted form, to the President for his signature, is this now infamous letter dated 18 March 2022. “H) Governor Weerasinghe directed the Governor’s Secretariat Office to locate these two drafts from the Governor’s Secretariat Office and these were found today and the two versions of these two drafts, duly certified by the Governor’s Secretariat, were forwarded by Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe to the 32B Respondent.

An Approximate of  70-80%cases that were taken to hearing has been lost. Is that what is meant by the IMF to eliminate corruption vulnerabilities by taking the EFF of the IMF forward?” He said that the Opposition is disappointed with the IMF as they are not living up to what they  said when starting the negotiations with the Government of Sri Lanka. “Corruption is everywhere.It is getting more that it is getting less. Walk the talk.”He also expressed his dismay over the allegation that has been made against the incumbent Secretary to the Treasury, K. M. Mahinda Siriwardana as the culprit of the economic crisis of Sri Lanka. He also said  that neither Mahinda Siriwardene nor his family should be penalised to the extent where Siriwardene made a complaint on his safety  as a media publication reported. De Silva said, “ such should not take place.”  He noted that many academic articles have been published on the economic crisis in Sri Lanka while reasons such as elimination of the taxes by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, ban of chemical fertiliser. And added that  the Government has been “irresponsible’ to wait till the foreign reserves deplete up to $ 30 million per the IMF has communicated to them when they met the IMF last year. Taking to his official X, de Silva said: “Offering our unwavering support to the Treasury Secretary amidst allegations tied to his past role as Deputy Gov of @CBSL. Let's maintain a constructive dialogue & prioritise #Accountability for the betterment of our nation. @IMFNews, your attention to this matter is crucial.”

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/qMcZtjP32EB9SIQezGV9,03 Mar 2024,Grounded ambitions,"In the annals of aviation history, national carriers often serve as emblematic symbols of a nation’s progress and aspirations. Yet, for Sri Lanka, the narrative surrounding its flagship airline, SriLankan Airlines, is one fraught with disappointment, turbulence, and missed opportunities. As the airline grapples with a litany of challenges, from operational inefficiencies to financial instability, the ramifications extend far beyond its balance sheets, casting a shadow over the country’s ambitions for tourism and economic development.The recent turmoil at Bandaranaike International Airport, where ground staff staged a protest over persistent issues within SriLankan Airlines, serves as a poignant manifestation of the deep-seated frustrations that permeate the airline’s workforce and its passengers alike. This display of discontent underscores the urgent imperative for comprehensive reforms within the airline, addressing not only immediate grievances but also the systemic issues that have plagued its operations for years.The incident involving a stowaway rat aboard a SriLankan Airlines flight serves as a microcosm of the challenges faced by the airline, emblematic of broader issues of mismanagement, neglect, and the erosion of public confidence. Beyond the inconvenience caused to passengers, the episode has raised serious concerns among investors, exacerbating the financial woes of an already debt-laden carrier.At the core of SriLankan Airlines’ woes lies a narrative of missed opportunities and misguided decisions. The termination of a lucrative management agreement with Emirates in 2008, amidst a political dispute, marked a pivotal moment for the airline, setting it on a downward trajectory from which it has struggled to recover. The failure to prioritise operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and strategic planning has left the airline teetering on the brink of insolvency, posing a threat to the country’s aspirations for economic growth and global connectivity.As Sri Lanka endeavours to recover from the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic and revitalise its tourism industry, the role of SriLankan Airlines assumes heightened significance. However, the airline’s tarnished reputation and precarious financial position present formidable obstacles to its resurgence. Without decisive action and a concerted effort to address its underlying problems, SriLankan Airlines risks becoming a liability rather than an asset to the country’s development agenda.The path forward for SriLankan Airlines necessitates a multifaceted approach encompassing short-term interventions and long-term strategies. Immediate measures must focus on restoring operational integrity, enhancing customer experience, and bolstering financial sustainability. Long-term initiatives should entail structural reforms, route optimisation, fleet modernisation, and strategic partnerships to enhance competitiveness and viability in the global aviation market.Crucially, reform efforts must be underpinned by principles of transparency, accountability, and stakeholder engagement. The Government, airline management, industry regulators, and other stakeholders must collaborate closely to chart a path forward for SriLankan Airlines that is rooted in pragmatism and vision. This entails confronting entrenched interests, addressing governance deficiencies, and fostering a culture of innovation and excellence.Ultimately, the fate of SriLankan Airlines is inextricably linked to the destiny of Sri Lanka itself. As the country navigates the complexities of a post-pandemic world and seeks to reclaim its position on the global stage, the success or failure of its national airline will reverberate far beyond the confines of the aviation industry. It is incumbent upon all stakeholders to rise to the occasion, seize the imperative for reform, and propel SriLankan Airlines towards a future characterised by stability, sustainability, and success.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/5dewtJSeYer3xKS3QLMQ,03 Oct 2023 | By Roshani Fernando,"‘SL should manufacture, not import vehicles’","In conversation with Automobile Industry Council Chairman Ravith SilvaSri Lanka’s automobile industry is of the view that lifting the ban on vehicle imports would greatly impact industrialists, as Sri Lanka should ideally start earning foreign exchange via manufacturing of products instead of spending on imports. According to Automobile Industry Council Chairman Ravith Silva, the first step would be to assemble vehicles in Sri Lanka with a local value addition of 25%, which would mean a reduction of 25% in forex outflow.In conversation with The Daily Morning Business, Silva highlighted the various challenges the automobile industry in Sri Lanka has been going through. The following are excerpts from the interview.What are the current challenges and opportunities facing the automobile industry in Sri Lanka amidst the import ban?If we consider the global situation, the story starts with the world order. The world order is in a continuously shifting mindset. Every half a century, the world order changes. As we started the turn of the century, the United States of America was at the top of the world order, as determined by the reserve currency that is used by most of the world’s population.But now, we can see that the reserve currency has been challenged. With initiatives such as vostro accounts Sri Lanka set up with India, for example, it has become possible to trade in rupees, where we are directly converting our currency to theirs. The world order was further challenged by the Covid-19 issue and then again by the war between Ukraine and Russia.In this context, Sri Lanka has always been a country where the East meets the West. Through the centuries, Sri Lanka has been a trader’s paradise, which is why we see a multi-ethnic community in Sri Lanka. Therefore, in a context where the world order is changing, Sri Lanka has been dependent on imports. But any business that spends more money than what it earns would obviously fail and that is what happened to Sri Lanka. We were living beyond our means; we were importing beyond what we were exporting.In that context, disruption actually gives us opportunity. Wherever there’s disruption, there is opportunity. Now, Sri Lanka needs to find an industrial mindset, in a context where, for example, the apparel industry is being challenged all over the world. We can see apparel companies are closing down and moving out. Their market space has changed because Bangladesh and Vietnam have gathered quite a lot of momentum in that area and created bilateral agreements to move their products, whereas Sri Lanka has not done that. We are reliant on the goods and services tax (GST)-plus only, while others have varying mechanisms to push their apparel.As a country, if we consider a 30% value addition with regard to vehicles coming into Sri Lanka, that in itself will save forex outflow. It is an opportunity for local industrialists to find a mechanism and engineer the system to develop local components. If the country employs professional engineers and does highly technical, high-quality value additions, then they will be opened up for world markets.For example, if Brand A comes down to Sri Lanka to supply the local market and we manufacture a small component, such as a battery, we wouldn’t have to think a lot. As soon as we get approval from the manufacturer to install the battery to the particular vehicle, we open up the opportunity, through the manufacturer, to supply to their supply chains all over the world.One of the challenges is that the world is changing. Everybody wants to be the top dog, so everybody is power-hungry; everybody wants the other person down. This in itself is an opportunity. For instance, Eastern companies do not have a market in countries like America and American products don’t have a market in the East. But if all these companies were to come down to Sri Lanka and invest in Sri Lanka, it would be a neutral ground where the Americas, Europe, and Eastern nations like China can come to trade.What is your opinion on the recent Cabinet approval to import electric vehicles (EVs) into the country without customs tariffs?It’s a double-edged sword. This was basically done to get manufacturers to Sri Lanka. If policymakers have solely focused on the local market when making the decision, then there is a bit of a concern because I don’t know if our national grid is up to handling an increased number of electric vehicles, as this would require a lot of power.However, if you consider China, they have two types of electric vehicles. One type has a long range while the other has smaller batteries with a shorter range. Therefore, long-range vehicles are used for long-range travel, which are a bit more expensive. Short-range vehicles are made to travel short distances. The consumer has to be intelligent in this regard because the problem with electric vehicles is that people buy the wrong car for the wrong application. The other thing to consider is the high electricity tariff. EVs consume a huge amount of energy because they need to be charged. The user has to analyse and evaluate these issues before buying a vehicle.Why is the Government so hesitant to regulate this industry? If you were to propose several regulatory measures on behalf of the Automobile Industry Council, what would they be?As a professional, I would say there are a lot of initiatives the Government can implement. The mandate of the Automobile Industry Council is centred around the development of knowledge, skills, and education. We did not have a council initially. We are grateful that, as it stands, a council has been established for a modest objective. But going forward, Sri Lanka needs to have a standards institute with regard to automobiles.The study of automobiles is a very vast subject and is a very unique subject. But do we have an education system where the study of the automobile is taught on its own merit? Among all the State universities, we only offer a generic mechanical engineering degree programme.We have 6,000 people applying to the Ceylon German Technical Training Institute. Out of the 6,000, only 600 applicants are accepted. The automobile industry is a logic-based industry. So, again, coming back to primary and secondary education, does the Sri Lankan education system, including the primary and secondary systems, include the study of automobiles as a subject? On the other hand, the Government needs to provide the relevant recognition. For instance, consider the Medical Council of Sri Lanka. The Medical Council regulates and licenses doctors, nurses, and pharmacists as well as pharmaceutical products. Sri Lanka has an engineering council. But does the engineering council recognise an automobile engineer? Does the engineering council recognise an automobile technician? Does it recognise an automobile equipment or material supplier? And do they license them? No. As it stands, these engineering bodies have to be updated. Can you provide insight into the trends and innovations that are shaping the future of the automobile sector in Sri Lanka?Before internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) and petrol and diesel cars came to the forefront, electric cars were the first cars in the world. In fact, the first car was an electric car.The problem they faced at the time was with regard to range because electric cars cannot travel a long distance. Bertha Benz, when she drove for 60 miles in her Benz car, was when people thought that it would be good for the long haul.Still, the range was the problem, and it was the only thing that needed to be solved. So she came up with the ICEV engine because it provided the required range, which the electric vehicle failed to do. Thus, for the last 200 years, range has been the problem because we do not have the technology to store energy for vehicles to travel a long distance and then recharge quickly.In this context, EVs are the future in most people’s minds simply because of sustainable development goals, as it is one way to reduce the carbon footprint.But then again, we have to question whether the range problem can be solved. There are vehicles that can do about 500-600 km per charge. But then again, how long does it take to recharge to travel another 500-600 km? This is a very crucial question that needs to be resolved. The first thing Sri Lanka can do is to change our road landscape laws and regulations to inculcate autonomous public vehicles and public service vehicles like buses. They travel the same route day in and day out. They don’t need to stop at different places. They start from one place and go from point A to point B and stop in between at designated places. Therefore, autonomous vehicles are a future trend that is coming to Sri Lanka. But Sri Lanka cannot harness this technology simply because we lack the appropriate road culture and road discipline. But again, it is something for regulators to think about. Are we going to look at future trends and prepare Sri Lanka for it? In that case, it has to be a gradual adaptation of technology. It has to be gradually implemented into society, otherwise, society will reject it. What are your thoughts on the recent statement that State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya made on the relaxation of import restrictions on lorries, trucks, and buses that are utilised for public transportation purposes?That of course is a quick way to put a nail in the coffin of industries. This is akin to asking a newborn to run as soon as it is born. How can a newborn child compete with an Olympic athlete? The Sri Lankan automobile industry is in its infancy. Although we started before India, India has progressed beyond us. If we consider their per capita gross domestic product (GDP) versus Sri Lanka’s, we are higher. We have more vehicles per person. We have eight million vehicles compared to 20 million inhabitants. Every family in Sri Lanka, according to statistics, has a vehicle, because our people are in a trading mentality.I do agree with trade but we have to empower local industries. India took a decision last month to ban all laptop imports to promote the assembling of laptops in their country. Imports have to be opened up but corrective measures and monetary and non-monetary decisions to safeguard local industrialists need to be taken as well.Currently, Sri Lanka has to start making money and stop spending money. To stop spending money, we need to start manufacturing in Sri Lanka. The first step is to assemble products in Sri Lanka with a local value addition of 25%. This means we would be reducing 25% of our forex outflow.If we spend $ 100 for a complete vehicle, now we would be spending only $ 75 and putting $ 25 into the local economy. This would ensure a positive local economic activity. The second stage is to export that $ 25 worth of components to Japan, America, China, or India. When we start exporting, we are offsetting another $ 25 from that $ 75. And when we export to Sri Lanka, if we assume we import 100 vehicles a year at $ 25, we are saving $ 25 into $ 100. But the moment we start exporting these components, we are exporting 1,000-2,000 units of that $ 25.Initially, we would be saving $ 25 per vehicle. If you import 100 vehicles, we would be saving $ 2,500. In the second stage, we would be exporting $ 25 per vehicle into 1,000 vehicles – that’s $ 25,000. And then we would offset that against 100 vehicles at $ 75, which would come to $ 7,500. You are left with $ 17,500.How does the council collaborate with government bodies and other stakeholders to support the growth of the automobile industry?he automobile council is backed by the Government but is led by the private sector. We do not utilise government money or government hand-me-downs to operate the council. We do not want to be a burden to the government but want to be a council that empowers the community as well as the country. And if you go to the nucleus of the council, it has to do with education, skills development, and dignity in the workplace. We are supported by a lot of organisations, as well as numerous government organisations. I believe it’s the first time that several ministries have got together and are working in a council. We have the Ministry of Industries, the Ministry of Transport as well as the Ministry of Education working together. We have six ex-officials, two academic institutions, and eight private organisations representing the private industry, while eight individuals from eight different industries within the government represent themselves.Regardless of whether they are in after-sales services, R&D, vehicle importers, or motor vehicle agents, they are all working together cohesively to develop certain things. We are trying to achieve inclusion and diversity. We want to include people with different abilities and disabilities in the automobile industry. We also want to allow diversity, which would include females working in the automobile industry. If you consider the rest of the world, most architects, design architects, and automobile design architects are females.As a council, we have already developed certain modules. Earlier, we had modules called NVQ4 and NVQ5. Now, with the council’s intervention, we have facilitated the development of NVQ+.

In 2019, the income generated by it was $ 1.5 billion which is a contribution of 2% of the gross domestic product (GDP), with a high potential to increase this revenue further. Furthermore, high demand for IT professionals in Sri Lanka in the world was also noted. Meanwhile, the IT sector’s contribution to India’s GDP is as high as 8%. Accordingly, a proposal was presented to the committee by the experts in the field to elevate the IT sector in Sri Lanka to a similar high-income-generating status.       It was also revealed that due to the recently introduced tax reforms, professionals in the IT sector are tempted to leave the country with many IT companies trying to move their business operations to other countries.

Therefore, among the recommendations to the Government to consider was to allow vehicle exports. However, the Sri Lanka Customs also ponder whether it is possible to give green light to that since vehicles are one of the major foreign exchange draining commodities to the country.    In a recent meeting between the Sectoral Oversight Committee (SOC) on National Economic and Physical Plans and Sri Lanka Customs held to discuss the contribution of the Sri Lanka Customs to the  government revenue, the Chairman of the SOC, MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage noted that Rs.1,226 billion are expected as income of Sri Lanka Customs in this year's budget and only Rs.330 billion received within the past 5 months. At the same time, the Sri Lanka Customs officials who were present at the meeting predicted that the income that can be obtained this year is Rs.783 billion while suggesting that possibilities  of importing vehicles under a credit line with a country such as Japan would be  the best way to increase the Customs’ revenue without forex draining. They further pointed out that if the proposals of the Customs are fulfilled, the revenue would reach around Rs.1,100 billion.

The G20 did so in 2020 with the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) and by establishing the Common Framework (CF) for debt resolution.Since then, she noted, the CF delivered a debt operation for Chad. It is now critical to complete Zambia’s debt restructuring, establish a Creditor Committee for Ghana, and advance work with Ethiopia, she further highlighted.“Nonetheless, more predictable, timely, and orderly processes are needed both for countries under the CF and for those not covered by it, including Sri Lanka and Suriname,” she said.

However, based on data published by the EDB, the first 10 months of 2023 showed a significant shortfall of $ 9.9 billion, down 10.54% Year-on-Year (YoY) from the performance recorded during the equivalent period in 2022. This decline in Sri Lankan exports has largely been blamed on the chaotic external environment amidst the Ukraine-Russia war and the Israel-Gaza war as well as the economic slowdown in the West.

Speaking to Ada Derana 24  on Sunday (15), the Minister said: “He (Shah Shah) has promised me (subject Minister) by the end of this month they (SOE) will get all the papers (for the EOI) ready and they will publish in the international media.” The minister further said that the airline has a debt owed to international markets, state banks and fuel suppliers of about $ 1.2 billion which includes $ 100 million owed to the lessors of the aircraft. “We can't run this airline because we need a capital injection. We have to have at least $ 500 million in capital to make this airline a viable airline. The Government has no money to do that and the Government doesn't intend to do that,” he said.Accordingly, De Silva said that the correct policy is to go into a joint venture to get the necessary capital and ensure the airline is running smoothly “We have not yet called for Expression of Interest (EOIs) from the buyers or from anybody who wants to come and invest here, but there are a lot of inquiries from us but we can't negotiate with them because now the Treasury is the owner of the airline,” he added.The Minister said that when the cabinet paper for the joint venture of SriLankan Airlines was first presented to the Cabinet, the Cabinet of ministers thought it prudent to refer it to the Treasury.He said that the Treasury has taken the view in consultation with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF) to appoint the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank's private sector investment arm as an independent transaction advisor.

It is a crisis, basically.” He noted that the impact would be similar to that of a crisis situation as the growth of the sector will be severely curtailed, while, simultaneously, the margins are to be further eroded. However, Sadique said that he cannot determine the exact extent of the impact at the moment. Following this tariff hike on retailers, only the evaluation of the repercussions can be observed, he said, responding to a query raised by The Daily Morning Business regarding the impact of the tariff hike. He added that the industry might resort to alternative measures to withstand the tide such as the use of generators to preserve energy, reduce costs, reduce working hours, etc.Meanwhile, The Daily Morning Business also contacted Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) Chairman Canisius Fernando on the matter. He said that whenever the prices of utilities increase, the industries encounter problems as margins are eroded and the numbers cannot run, which ultimately results in the closing down of companies. He commented: “We cannot manage now. Diesel prices have gone up, then the electricity (tariff), and now the water (tariff), and taxes; what else is there to be increased? Meanwhile, The Daily Morning reported yesterday (20) Hotel Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) President M. Shanthikumar to have said: “They have placed the hotel industry on a super tariff where the increase is 27% more than that of any other industry. This is an unfair increase. Therefore, although electricity tariffs have increased, we are not in a position to increase rates.” Minister of Water Supply Jeevan Thondaman recently said that a water tariff hike is also likely while the Ministry is exploring alternatives such as renewable energy.

(AASL) reveals.Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, AASL Chairman Maj. Gen. (Retd) G.A. Chandrasiri stated that the construction work on the superstructure of the BIA Terminal II project would continue to remain suspended until Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) initiated the release of funds following the completion of the debt restructuring process.However, in the interim, the AASL has received Cabinet approval to commence construction work in respect of certain selected works with an approved budget of Rs. 500 million. Accordingly, the AASL has called for tenders and selected Access Engineering to carry out the related construction. Chandrasiri also disclosed that the construction pertaining to these works was anticipated to span approximately five months.He stated: “Things are done in stages. Firstly, we commenced the maintenance work. We have now commenced construction on certain selected work. Once the restructuring is completed, if JICA fails to return, we will start construction on the main project.”He further indicated that the AASL had already identified certain other additional selected works. He explained that once the ongoing construction of the selected works was completed within the next five months and if JICA funds remained inaccessible, the AASL would proceed to issue a new tender and appoint a contractor to undertake the construction of those additional works. He emphasised that this would be an ongoing process until the JICA funds became available.Chandrasiri stressed that work on the superstructure would commence only once the JICA funds had been released and that the AASL funds would not be used for the purpose. He also disclosed that the AASL was undertaking separate maintenance work at the project site, with a monthly cost of Rs. 10 million.The contract for the construction of the BIA Terminal II project, which involves the construction of a multi-level terminal, was valued at $ 564 million and awarded to the Taisei Corporation in 2020. According to the terms of the JICA funding, the contractor must be Japanese. However, with the stoppage of construction work last year due to the funding freeze imposed by JICA following Sri Lanka’s default, Taisei Corporation terminated its contract with Sri Lanka.The construction of this multi-level terminal is part of Package A of the BIA expansion project which is estimated to cost Rs. 133 billion and will be largely funded by the Special Term for Economic Partnership (STEP) concessionary Official Development Assistance (ODA) loan granted by JICA amounting to Rs. 131.5 billion (¥ 74.4 billion) at a 0.1% interest rate per annum. The remaining Rs. 21.5 billion is being funded by AASL.With regard to Package A, the AASL entered into two agreements with JICA – the first agreement was entered into in March 2012 for ¥ 29 billion and the second agreement was entered into in March 2016 for ¥ 45.4 billion.

The significant drop in export sales contributed to a 370 basis point year-on-year contraction in the Group’s gross profit margin to 10.0%, as capacity utilisation rates decreased across its global network of manufacturing facilities. A rise in finance costs as a result of increased interest rates as well as the hike in corporate tax rates were also significant drags on profitability. As a result, the Hela Group recorded a post-tax loss of Rs. 1.7 billion in the third quarter. Despite the challenging circumstances, the Group’s balance sheet remained in a robust position at the close of the third quarter. The Net-Debt-to-Equity ratio stood at 1.8 at the end of December 2022, compared to 3.8 during the same period of the previous year. In a statement accompanying the financial results, the company identified tentative signs of stabilisation in the economic outlook for its key markets. It cited the declines in inflation rates recorded in recent months across Europe and North America, as well as the ongoing strength of labour markets in these economies, as indicators of a more resilient outlook for consumer spending. Nonetheless, it struck a cautious tone and emphasised the need to remain agile in the evolving operating environment to ensure a return to profitability in the short term. It also highlighted the management team’s confidence in the strength of the company’s value proposition, underpinned by its competitive global manufacturing footprint and strategic customer relationships, positioning it well to take advantage of a future recovery in demand.Hela Apparel Holdings PLC is a social capital-focused company built on the principles of inclusivity, equality, and climate stability. With over three decades of industry experience, Hela focuses on building strategic partnerships with global brands to provide apparel supply chain solutions with distinctive advantages. The organisation has a global presence with 10 manufacturing facilities across Sri Lanka, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Egypt as well as design centres in Sri Lanka, the US, the UK, and France, providing direct employment to over 20,000 people. Innovative, ethical, and sustainable apparel manufacturing is at the centre of Hela’s operations.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/7KgvIK6IapO18FFwFz3Y,14 May 2023 | By Madhusha Thavapalakumar,Plenty of fish in the sea,"Why does a country surrounded by the ocean import fish?Sri Lanka, an island nation cradled by the pristine waters of the Indian Ocean, stands as a testament to the allure of coastal living. With its abundance of marine resources and a vast exclusive economic zone, it seems counterintuitive for Sri Lanka to find itself reliant on fish imports.Despite naturally advantageous conditions, Sri Lanka has experienced substantial growth in fish imports in recent years, raising questions about the utilisation of its marine resources. This week’s ‘Market Mine’ will delve into Sri Lanka’s fish production, examine its exports and imports, and explore the factors contributing to its fish importation, ultimately uncovering the complexities of this dynamic industry.Fish production in Sri LankaSri Lanka’s fish industry has deep historical roots, with fishing activities serving as a vital source of livelihood for coastal communities. The industry contributes significantly to both domestic consumption and export markets. The coastal regions, particularly the Western, Southern, and Northern Provinces, are focal points for fish production. Additionally, inland water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and reservoirs provide opportunities for freshwater fish production.The latest available data from the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources reveals a noteworthy increase in fish production. In 2020, Sri Lanka produced an impressive 347,237 MT of fish, indicating a substantial rise from the previous year’s output of 288,497 MT. This upward trend can be attributed to several factors, including favourable weather conditions, increased investment in the sector, and the adoption of improved fishing techniques.Sri Lanka’s fish trade The export market plays a pivotal role in Sri Lanka’s fish industry, contributing to the country’s economic growth. The European Union, the US, and Japan are among the primary destinations for Sri Lankan fish products. Tuna, swordfish, and prawns are particularly sought-after commodities in these markets.Fish exportsExport earnings from fish and fish preparations amounted to $ 301.2 million last year while the previous year (2021) recorded $ 316 million, as per the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) statistics. According to the Export Development Board, the nation generated $ 207.7 million from fish exports in 2020 – a slight decrease from the previous year’s earnings of $ 208.7 million. While the figures remained relatively stable, challenges in the global market, including trade barriers and fluctuating demand, necessitated a strategic approach to ensure the sustained growth of fish exports.Fish importsSurprisingly, Sri Lanka has witnessed a notable increase in fish imports, despite its abundance of marine resources. Import expenditure on fish and fish preparations amounted to $ 67.7 million last year while the previous year (2021) recorded $ 123.6 million, as per CBSL statistics. In 2020, the country imported 70,248 MT of fish, valued at $ 189.8 million. This marked a significant rise from the previous year’s imports of 55,622 MT, worth $ 142.2 million. To comprehend the underlying reasons for this phenomenon, multiple factors must be considered.1. Changing consumer preferences: Sri Lanka has experienced a shift in consumer preferences towards convenience and value-added fish products. Canned fish, frozen fish, and processed seafood items have gained popularity due to their ease of preparation and longer shelf life. Meeting this evolving demand requires a diversified import strategy to cater to the growing appetite for such products.2. Domestic demand outstripping supply: Sri Lanka’s population, with its burgeoning middle class and increasing urbanisation, has demonstrated a heightened demand for fish. As the demand rises, domestic fish production struggles to keep pace due to various challenges such as limited fishing infrastructure, outdated technology, and resource management issues. Consequently, imports have filled the gap to meet the growing demand.3. Specialised fish varieties: Sri Lanka’s marine ecosystem offers a rich diversity of fish species, but some prized varieties may not be as abundant in local waters. Importing specific fish species allows Sri Lankan consumers to access a wider range of seafood choices.4. Inadequate infrastructure: Sri Lanka’s fishing infrastructure, including harbours, landing sites, and cold storage facilities, requires significant improvement to support efficient fish harvesting, processing, and storage. The lack of modern infrastructure hampers the industry’s capacity to capitalise on the abundant fish stocks.5. Limited technological advancements: Technological advancements, such as advanced fishing vessels, fish finders, and processing equipment play a crucial role in maximising fishery potential. However, the local fishing industry faces limitations in adopting and implementing these technologies, resulting in suboptimal productivity and reduced competitiveness in the global market.6. Resource management and sustainability: Effective resource management is vital to maintain fish stocks and ensure long-term sustainability. Sri Lanka faces challenges in implementing comprehensive and well-regulated fisheries management practices, leading to overfishing, habitat degradation, and a decline in certain fish populations. These issues further contribute to the need for fish imports to meet domestic demand.International market dynamics and export prioritiesSri Lanka’s fish industry is not solely driven by domestic considerations, but is also influenced by international market dynamics and export priorities. While the country exports a significant amount of fish, certain factors contribute to the importation of specific fish varieties.Market preferences and trade agreements: Sri Lanka’s fish exports are subject to market preferences and stringent quality standards imposed by international buyers. Some fish varieties in high demand in export markets may not align with local consumption patterns, leading to an export-oriented focus rather than catering solely to domestic needs. Consequently, imports become necessary to fulfil the local demand for fish that is not exported.Trade imbalances and cost competitiveness: The global fish market is highly interconnected, with fluctuations in supply and demand influencing prices and trade patterns. Sri Lanka’s fish imports often stem from trade imbalances, where importing certain fish varieties is more cost-effective than relying solely on domestic production or attempting to compete in the export market.Need for a multifaceted approach When contacted, a Ministry of Fisheries spokesperson told The Sunday Morning Business that the ministry was exploring every possible avenue to increase fish production and to ensure that the country became self-sufficient in certain categories. However, he added that importing was sometimes inevitable due to local demand, lack of supply, and related issues.Government support and policy reforms are vital to drive the growth of the domestic fishing industry. Effective governance, transparent regulations, and targeted incentives can incentivise investment in the sector. Financial assistance, access to credit, and subsidies for equipment and infrastructure development can further encourage local fishermen. A comprehensive policy framework that addresses challenges, encourages innovation, and fosters sustainable practices will create an enabling environment for the domestic fishing industry to flourish.Sri Lanka’s dependence on fish imports despite its coastal advantages is a complex issue influenced by a combination of factors. Insufficient domestic supply, seasonal variations, evolving consumption patterns, economic considerations, and an export-oriented fishing industry all contribute to the country’s reliance on fish imports. Addressing these challenges would require a multifaceted approach, including sustainable fishing practices, investment in infrastructure, technology adoption, and strategic policy decisions to promote domestic fish production and reduce the need for imports.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/zlxsbfecFKAP6xM0zNmB,25 May 2023,EPF must be safeguarded in domestic debt optimisation - Harsha de Silva,"Sri Lankan Opposition MP Harsha de Silva said that  the interests of Employees Provident Fund (EPF) pension fund members needs to be prioritised in any decision-making process regarding Domestic Debt Optimization.  Speaking on behalf of the Opposition, de Silva stated: ""We must protect the EPF pension fund from being subjugated to the government's needs at the expense of pensioners. The negative 47% real return to EPF in 2022 has severely eroded the value of the fund, and we cannot disregard this significant loss.”Referring to the EPF Act, de Silva also underscored the obligation for a parliamentary resolution to ensure the EPF receives sufficient funds from the Treasury to meet minimum payment requirements if it is unable to do so. ""Our foremost concern should be securing the retirement benefits of the hardworking people of Sri Lanka. The EPF, as a pension fund, plays a crucial role in ensuring a financially secure future for its members upon retirement. We cannot allow the government's pursuit of cheap money to jeopardise the interests of EPF pensioners,"" de Silva added.He emphasised that considering the negative real interest rate the EPF pension fund has already experienced, it is unjust to overburden it further with large opportunity costs due to domestic debt optimisation. The interests of EPF members must be prioritised to strike a balance between preserving reasonable returns to the members while providing debt relief to the government as the long-term financial security of Sri Lanka's workforce cannot be jeopardised.He further emphasised the importance of gradually settling any resulting loans over time.Discussing the risks associated with domestic debt optimisation, de Silva highlighted the concept of opportunity cost. ""For instance, if the EPF currently holds bonds maturing within the next one or two years, they have the potential to be reinvested at higher rates, ensuring better returns for pensioners. However, if these bonds' maturity dates are extended beyond 2027 at lower rates that will have a high opportunity cost to EPF members.""Clarifying the EPF pension fund's overall financial position, de Silva reassured the public that the EPF is not facing immediate trouble. The EPF pension fund maintains a positive cash flow, with contributions consistently exceeding pension payouts by approximately 30 billion rupees in recent years which ensures the EPF's ability to meet its pension obligations. “However, we must acknowledge that returns on investments may decrease,"" he stressed. At the same time, he explained that subjecting the EPF pension fund to this optimisation may result in a loss of potential re-investment opportunities.

Pathirage said: “We announced it (single use plastic ban) in February following the cabinet approval. Actually, we planned to ban it this June parallel to the Environment Day. But considering the stocks in the market, we have given a grace period till 1 October to clean up the stocks.”   Following the cabinet approval to ban single use plastic, the CEA has also conducted a campaign of awareness programmes. Responding to the inquiry made by The Daily Morning Business whether the CEA conducted discussions with stakeholders on the matter with the said industry prior to the announcement on banning, he responded:“Yes, we have already discussed. This ban was a process of one year. Before drafting any gazette, 3-4 stakeholder meetings take place with the product manufacturers and consumers to seek their consultation.”   When it comes to introducing alternatives for the single use plastic products, Pathirage noted that last week, another meeting was held between the plastic alternative producers and the industries in introducing environmentally-friendly alternatives. Thus, the alternatives that have been provided are wooden forks and spoons, paper straws while alternatives for garlands and stringhopper trays are already available in the market. Also the heaviest consumers of these plastic products are international food chains in the country as they utilise plastic forks and spoons, CEA Chair added.  The CEA banned the manufacture and sale of single-use plastic products in the country with effect from 1 October while stating that any violation of the said order would be strictly dealt with under the legal stipulations laid down in the National Environmental Act. Accordingly, single-use plastic straws and stirrers,single-use plastic plates, cups (except yoghurt cups), knives, spoons (including yoghurt spoons) and forks, plastic flower garlands, plastic stringhopper trays have been subjected to this prohibition.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/qbAdYEcBpF3H6MEMx3ys,21 Mar 2024 | BY Imesh Ranasinghe,More interest in equities with interest rate decline,"More interest will be seen for equities as an asset with the reduction of interest rates, said the Head of Research at CT CLSA Holdings Ltd. Oshadha de Vas Gunasekara, in an interview with The Daily Morning Business, as fixed deposits in banks will give single-digit returns after-tax adjustments and “that should translate into the equity market seeing good returns this year.”He explained that the reasons multinational companies are delisting from the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) could be the negative impact of credit ratings and low valuations with the country in a sovereign default.With the decline in interest rates, “... naturally there will be a decline in investments from the banking sector in the government treasuries...” Gunasekara said adding that banks would want to start growing their loan disbursements.He also said that Sri Lanka should look to conclude the external debt restructuring by June or July and not push it too close to the elections putting the third review of the International Monetary Fund(IMF) programme at risk.Following are excerpts from the interview:How do you see Sri Lanka’s current economic path? Does it show signs of recovery or is there more to be done?With all the reforms that were done over the last year or so, and then having support from the IMF programme plus some of the other multilateral lenders plus with the debt restructuring happening and expected to conclude in about another 3-4 months. We are expecting the economy to stabilise in 2024 and we are looking at GDP growth of about 2% for the year.In terms of uncertainties, you have the elections coming up towards the end of the year. However, since we are coming off a low base we expect about 2% growth to be achievable this year.In terms of things that are yet to be done, of course, there are more reforms that will have to be made such as improving efficiency in the public sector, divesting the non-strategic SOEs and then having policy stability to attract significant investments into the country.One of the key positives is that tourism is picking up in a significant way and that will benefit the economy as we have already seen. It will be even more pronounced this year because it will be the first full year since 2018 that we should be seeing significant amounts of arrivals. But there are things to improve such as improving airport capacity and attracting more high-spending tourists.What are your thoughts on the ongoing external debt restructuring? Will Sri Lanka be able to secure a deal with the private creditors? I would say external debt restructuring is on track, the Central Bank Governor has mentioned that it should be completed during the first half of 2024, so I think if we can finish it off by June, or July this year, it would be ideal.The three-year moratorium expected from the external debt restructuring will give us some breathing space to put clear national policies and implement those in order to transform the economy into a net foreign currency earner.What are the implications of further delays in completing restructuring?If the debt restructuring is delayed it will have a negative impact in terms of us putting the economy on track, for the longer term because it will have a knock-on effect on attracting funding lines and FDIs for development projects. And then you have the elections coming up also, so you don't want the debt restructuring to be pushed too close to elections. I would say from the country’s perspective it's better if we can conclude it as soon as possible.Sri Lanka will be facing the third review of the IMF programme by September, which is supposed to happen after completing debt restructuring according to the Government’s expectation, if the debt restructuring is not completed by then of course, the third review could be at risk at that point.If the IMF programme is to be extended beyond its original time period, what sort of an impact will it have on the country?I think that is up to the Government basically, the IMF programme, however long it is doesn’t really matter, Sri Lanka should put things right if you want to put the economy on track, so it doesn't matter whether the IMF programme is 3 or 4 years, they know what has to be done.Even if you are in an IMF programme or not things such as government fiscal deficit and trade deficit should be fixed in order for us to have a sustainable growth trajectory going forward.However, being in an IMF programme helps to improve our credibility.How has Sri Lanka’s equity market landscape changed since the economic crisis? What are the forecasts for this year?In terms of the equity market of course we have had some tough times over the last two and a half years, so valuations still in some sectors are quite cheap and I think in terms of earnings also we have been at the bottom. The company earnings should start improving in 2024, for some of the sectors it has already started to improve, things such as electricity tariff being reduced are positives for industries in general because their operating cost will reduce.Plus for the consumer-facing companies, given that low electricity prices will result in higher disposable incomes, the consumer spending will improve which will result in volumes also picking up for those companies. So from the fundamental perspective, we are looking at earnings improving and that should help in improving interest in fundamentally strong companies.But if you are looking at it from a macroeconomic angle, the other thing is of course the domestic side of things where the interest rates have come off, so that should ideally mean that equities as an asset class generally should see more interest now given that you are looking at single digit return from your fixed deposit in a bank after you adjust for taxes. Ideally, that should translate into the equity market seeing good returns this year. Also, we are hopeful that some foreign interests will also improve this year with the debt restructuring being finalised.The external debt restructuring was one of the key overhangs in the equity market and I think that getting concluded could result in banking sector shares seeing a good rally also because they are still trading at quite low valuations around 45-50% of book value. They have taken a significant hit in terms of provisioning for the ISB investments they have made, once the ultimate loss on ISBs is finalised after the completion of the external debt restructuring there could be a rally in the banking sector.What are your thoughts on listed companies exiting the market?When you look at some of these companies that are delisting, they are multinational companies and some of the reasons that could be impacting the delisting, are credit ratings and valuations that are quite low and delisting when the valuations are a bit depressed also makes more sense from the management’s perspective.When you are working with international companies headquartered in a country with a weak credit rating and sovereign default it might be slightly negative for them in their operations as well. So those could be the reasons behind the delisting but in general, any listed company should anyway have the right to delist if they want to as long as the delisting happens at a fair price point for the minority shareholders, there shouldn’t be an issue.In terms of new listings, I think a lot of IPOs generally take place when the market is doing well. In 2021 the market was booming and the overall economy was also doing well. I think going into 2024/2025 we are expecting the economy to pick up and then IPOs should start to come in from the second half of 2024 or so and delistings could reduce because valuations will pick up in the market.The banking sector has been having a tough time since the pandemic which was worsened by the economic crisis. Has the sector started to recover? Are the provisions provided for the restructuring more than sufficient?The banking sector has been impacted with credit quality ever since the Easter Sunday attacks which was followed by COVID and then the economic crisis. Throughout those four years, they have had provisionings on loan books increasing and in addition to that because of the sovereign default, they had to provide for foreign currency-denominated Sri Lanka government bonds as well.In terms of the ISBs, most of the banks have provided somewhere in the range of 50-52% of their outstanding balances. I think it is a bit too early to comment on whether it is more than sufficient but I think that is more or less sufficient to cover the risk. Even if they had to increase it to about 55% or 60%, the increase is not too significant.The impact will come in two ways for the ISBs held by the banks, one will be principal haircut which would probably be about 30% and the rest will be the time value impact because they will be receiving the cash flows later than expected earlier when they took on the instrument because there will be an extension to the maturity. So both of those together will only bring this impairment impact.What are the forecasts for the banking sector, in terms of credit growth, Non-Performing Loans(NPLs), interest rates and why?I think in terms of private credit growth we are looking at about 10% growth for 2024, NPLs anyway have now kind of stabilised and have actually started to come down in Q4 2023, it is difficult to put a number to where NPLs will end up by the end of this year but I think it could come off to closer to about 10-11% in the second half of the year but it will all depend on the economic growth plus interest rates remain during the course of the year. But 2025 of course definitely should come off to single digits.The interest rates have come off quite significantly and it's resulting in lower interest rate margins for the banks also, so lower interest rates will probably remain over the next few months but overall the system’s interest rates might see a slight increase by 2-3% closer to the end of the year with elections approaching and demand for credit picking up.The Central Bank is looking at adopting a single policy rate rather than the two rates that they have, so they could adopt the single rate even in March or later in the year, when that happens, it effectively means that there could be a 100 bps rate cut.Will the suspension of Parate Law make access to credit more difficult?Parate Law is one way for banks to recover their losses in terms of bad loans, so that being removed for most of this year is obviously a negative for the banking sector. I think the Government is coming from the perspective that they need to give some space to businesses to pick up as the economy now recovers, which is also fair, but what could happen is banks will be a bit more conservative in lending. This could slightly impact credit growth also given that this recovery mechanism is suspended for now With the completion of the debt restructuring do you think the banks will move away from their investments in government securities or will they stay in the securities market until there is real economic growth?I think what will happen is, now that the interest rates are lower banks will start to increase their loan disbursements. When that happens they will not be growing their investment portfolios as much as seen in the last few years simply because the interest rates on offer on the Treasury Bills are not as attractive as when they were around 20-25%. So naturally there will be a decline in investments from the banking sector in the government treasuries but it will be a gradual decline and stabilise at normal levels. Anyway, the banks for regulatory requirements need to maintain a certain value in liquid assets and Treasury Bills and Bonds are liquid assets, so the banks will not fully move away from the investments in government securities.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/CePSVPe6jdSexbGqV2dp,09 Mar 2023 | By Imsha Iqbal,SMEs to take another hit from policy rate hike,"CNCI Chairman says ‘nobody’ will investNotes people hesitant to spend money on non-essentials The recently raised policy interest rates by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is to further fluctuate economic activities while also affecting businesses, The Daily Morning Business learns. Speaking to The Daily Morning Business Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) Chairman Canisius Fernando said: “At the moment, economic activities are extremely limited and when there is a lending rate of 32-34% for the corporate and for any loans, nobody is really going to invest.”   The CBSL raised the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 100 basis points to 15.50% and 16.50%, respectively, effective from the close of business on 3 March 2023. Fernando noted that lower interest rates contribute to increase in production, as a result of which commodity prices come down, providing the general public with breathing space as purchasing power improves. Thereafter, inflation can be expected to come down as well.  He explained that when interest rates come down, it creates a healthy environment for investments, especially with regard to leasing facilities, while economic activities flourish. For local investors, overhead costs have curtailed the expansion of their businesses. Commenting further, he said: “Leasing facilities have collapsed. People who are involved in that sector are facing problems; people are not willing to spend money on high-end purchases such as a vehicle unless it is an absolute necessity.”    The Daily Morning Business also contacted Colombo Chamber of Commerce ( CCC ) President Saranga Wijeyratne in this regard, and he stated: “We have to accept that the decision (to raise interest rates) has been taken to demonstrate Sri Lanka’s commitment to the IMF (International Monetary Fund). That was clearly communicated.”The Central Bank, in its statement issued last Friday (3), noted: “This decision (raising of policy interest rates) demonstrates Sri Lanka’s commitment to the IMF-EFF arrangement, which has been pursued by the Government in order to ensure stability in the economy on multiple fronts. The finalisation of the IMF-EFF arrangement is expected to benefit all stakeholders and bolster confidence, which would help restore stability in the economy on a sustained basis. This will incentivise more foreign exchange flows in the period ahead that would aid the economy to overcome the prevailing economic crisis.”As a result, this will have a positive impact on foreign investments in terms of attracting more of the same to the country as it is currently in “a critical state”.Following the CBSL decision on interest rates, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, stated on her official Twitter account: “ I welcome the progress made by Sri Lankan authorities in taking decisive policy actions and obtaining financing assurances from all their major creditors, including China, India, and the Paris Club. Look forward to presenting the IMF-supported programme to our Exec. Board on 20 March.”

(SLIC) at ‘A(lka),’ Continental Insurance Lanka Ltd. at ‘A-(lka),’ HNB Assurance PLC at ‘A-(lka),’ HNB General Insurance Ltd. at ‘A-(lka),’ People’s Insurance PLC at ‘A-(lka),’ Co-Operative Insurance Company PLC at ‘BB(lka),’ and Construction Guarantee Fund at ‘BB(lka)’.One factor driving the ratings is easing investment and liquidity risks. The removal of the RWN on the insurers’ national ratings reflects Fitch’s view that near-term investment and liquidity risks have been reduced substantially, evident from the upgrade of Sri Lanka’s long-term local-currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to ‘CCC-’ from ‘RD’ and the subsequent removal of the RWN on Fitch-rated banks.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/c98GGtIzINKsWByzRJOL,24 Aug 2023 | BY Tom Singleton,Meta to launch web version of flagging Threads app,"Meta is releasing a web version of Threads, as it attempts to revive the social media platform.The rival to X, formerly known as Twitter, enjoyed meteoric growth when it launched in July.However, users then abandoned it just as rapidly, partly due to its limited functionality.Meta says the web version is part of a drive to deliver new features but experts warn more needs to be done to rebuild customer interest.In a post on the platform, accompanied by what he said was a picture of him building Threads for the web, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said it would be ""rolling out over the next few days.""Users will be able to post a thread, view their feed and interact with other people's threads.However other aspects of the mobile app will not be available on the web initially.For example, users won't be able to edit their profile or send a thread to the direct messenger feature of its sister platform, Instagram.Meta says it will add more functionality in the coming weeks as it seeks to make the web and mobile experience of the app the same.Threads raced to more than 100 million users in the week following its launch but by the end of July that figure had more than halved. The tech giant, which also owns Facebook and WhatsApp, hopes that this announcement will help reverse that trend.""Meta made the choice to launch Threads in a very basic form,"" said Rebecca McGrath, associate director for media and technology at Mintel. ""This has frustrated users who checked out the platform following its much-hyped launch, and were expecting it to be a ready-to-go alternative to Twitter,"" she added. ""Offering a web version is a very important step. However, it still has a way to go.""The platform still does not have a search function - something users have complained about and experts say it needs if it is to really take on Elon Musk's X.""Meta is going to have to work to roll out a vastly improved search functionality to let users find topic-based communities to really draw back the crowd who are looking to replace Twitter,"" Professor of internet studies at Curtin University in Australia Tama Leaver, told the BBC.""On that front, Meta's reluctance to implement hashtags, especially as they're already on Instagram, seems an odd choice when really that's the single feature that's most synonymous with X and the function that would most likely convince users to come back and give Threads a second look.""Prof. Leaver also said Threads' attempts to dethrone X might be aided by the controversies that continue to dog the platform previously known as Twitter.On Monday it was criticised for failing to remove a Holocaust-denying post quickly enough.  Musk's plans to remove the block feature have also drawn criticism, with some saying it will make it harder to stop abusive messages.Rebecca McGrath from Mintel agrees, saying the ""continued controversial moves"" at X would ""keep up the desire"" for an alternative.""This means people will be ready to engage with Threads once again when it has a more advanced version,"" she told the BBC.""Time, though, is still of the essence for Threads.""(BBC)

How can we export to countries when there is an additional expense of 57% for us through the imposition of VAT, CESS, PAL, and Customs duty? How can we export at competitive prices?” he questioned.SLUNBA Chairperson Tania Abeysundara also said that Bangkok was facing a similar issue in its domestic market due to duty-free imports from China through the FTA between the two countries.“All imports come to Thailand duty-free through the FTA with China, putting their local industries at risk, so they are looking to sign an FTA with another country in order to save their domestic industries,” she added.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/INmYvAFsgAFtrVBk3e5A,03 Aug 2023,State Minister moots innovative strategies to boost tourism industry,"State Minister of Tourism Diana Gamage says during the first seven months of this year, Sri Lanka welcomed a significant influx of 763,000 tourists, contributing to a substantial income of approximately $ 800 million.She highlighted the success of President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s programme aimed at strengthening the national economy through the growth of the tourism industry. This accomplishment has played a crucial role in bolstering Sri Lanka’s foreign reserves, the lawmaker commented further.Sri Lanka’s tourism industry suffered a huge setback last year due to the economic crisis, Gamage said, noting that after Wickremesinghe took office as the President, the “era of queues” in the country came to an end, while the economy slowly bounced back. At the same time, a favourable situation was created for the tourism industry, she added.Gamage shared these remarks during a press briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), themed “Collective Path to a Stable Country”.She emphasised the importance of introducing new approaches and adopting innovative strategies to enhance the tourism industry, while underscoring the necessity of developing vibrant and active cities to attract tourists, stating that visitors do not seek out lifeless destinations or dead cities.In line with its efforts to boost tourism, the State Ministry of Tourism in Sri Lanka has undertaken a new programme to promote the country as an attractive tourist destination, Gamage said adding that Sri Lanka hosted the final round of the Miss Tourism World pageant, with contestants from 30 countries visiting and exploring the beauty of the island.Meanwhile, a significant milestone is set to take place at the end of this year, as Sri Lanka plans to host the final competition of the World Travel Awards (WTA) in December, according to Gamage, who said this prestigious event is expected to see the participation of 117 countries, further elevating Sri Lanka’s status as a global tourism destination.Speaking further, the State Minister underscored the importance of a robust regulatory framework to safeguard the interests of both tourists and the tourism sector. In this regard, the Government has taken steps to implement a system that evaluates the quality of accommodations, such as Air B&B and homestays, provided to tourists. By maintaining high-quality facilities and services, Sri Lanka can attract more tourists and enhance the overall tourism experience, she explained.Addressing speculations regarding the cultivation of hemp (cannabis), Gamage said the focus is not on its use as an intoxicant. “Cannabis, indeed, is classified as a drug, but it also has significant potential for medical and industrial purposes. In fact, there are 22 varieties of cannabis in Sri Lanka and numerous medicinal products that can be derived from hemp, presenting a significant opportunity for Sri Lanka to capitalise on its cultivation and exports.”Pointing out that hemp cultivation is gaining prominence globally, and Sri Lanka has the potential to become a leader in this industry, the State Minister said there are lucrative investment prospects in producing medicines from hemp, which can yield substantial economic benefits for the country. “A ten-acre hemp plantation alone has the potential to generate around $ 200 million.”The State Minister went on to highlight the vitality of implementing a night economy system in order to boost the tourism industry. “Tourists seek destinations that provide them with the freedom to enjoy life to the fullest. Closing tourist destinations early, such as at 10 p.m., would discourage tourists from visiting. To attract tourists, it is essential to create vibrant and lively environments, not ‘dead cities’ (areas with limited nightlife).”She said it is crucial to extend the operating hours of tourist destinations, allowing visitors to have a more enjoyable experience to attract more tourists. “This may involve keeping certain places open later into the night, providing various entertainment options, and facilitating activities that appeal to tourists.Furthermore, establishing direct flight services with international airlines, such as Chinese and Italian airlines, will enhance accessibility and convenience for tourists, Gamage commented that these partnerships can help bring in more visitors and contribute to the growth of Sri Lanka’s tourism sector.

Media reports on 14 December stated that it was mentioned at the Cabinet briefing that the CBSL had concluded these negotiations,” said Dr. Weerasinghe. He made this clarification following his address at the inauguration of the CA Sri Lanka Annual Research Symposium 2022 at the CA Sri Lanka premises, where he was present as Chief Guest.   Dr. Weerasinghe noted that the statement at the Cabinet briefing was “probably a miscommunication”. He added: “I would like to make it clear that we have not concluded the negotiations yet. We have made a lot of progress, but we are still in the process of completing the negotiations with creditor nations.” He also said that the intention of the CBSL is to complete negotiations with creditor nations in January and obtain their financial assurances through the progress thus achieved. Dr. Nandalal participated in the CA Sri Lanka event as Chief Guest, where he delivered an address titled “Deep roots of Sri Lanka’s current economic condition and the short-term recovery strategy”.At the Cabinet briefing on Tuesday, responding to a question raised by a journalist regarding when Sri Lanka would be provided the IMF bailout, Cabinet Co-Spokesman Dr. Gunawardana said: “We (the Cabinet) are not the authorised institution. The Central Bank and  the authorities of the Ministry of Finance are the ones working on this. As far as I know, the CBSL Governor has informed the President that the discussions with the creditor nations – China, India, and Japan – have concluded successfully.”Accordingly, Dr. Gunawardana said, Sri Lanka will be able to receive the IMF bailout by January, as previously announced, claiming that this could be confirmed with the CBSL.The Morning Business reported on Monday (12) that the country was unable to obtain financial assurances from creditors in November despite the CBSL’s expectations in this regard, as certain creditors faced internal issues preventing such.“We were unable to get the financial assurances in the month of November. Had we been able to get them in November, we were targeting 19 December for the next IMF Executive Board meeting (to obtain its approval),” said the CBSL Governor in an interview with TV Derana last Thursday (8).

To mitigate this, he plans discussions with international financial institutions to transition towards an export-oriented economy swiftly.He concluded by emphasising the substantial relief provided to the people despite the bankruptcy status, asserting that efforts to stabilise the economy ultimately benefit the nation.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/hYG9JzUFFQV3ax9bMkRS,21 Mar 2023 | By Imsha Iqbal,Tea exports drop amidst hesitancy to use fertiliser,"Due to the high cost of living, the hesitancy of 50% of smallholders of the tea industry to use fertiliser have resulted in a drop in tea exports for the second consecutive month of the year, The Daily Morning Business learns. Speaking to The Daily Morning Business, Sri Lanka Tea Board (Tea Board) Chairman Niraj de Mel stated: “We have done marginally better in February this year even though we are not that happy with the production performance in January and February. But it is all to do with fertiliser application which did not go at the expected level, particularly in the smallholder sector.”When The Daily Morning Business inquired about the fertiliser application, de Mel clarified saying that due to the high cost of living, some smallholders have not used fertiliser, while some have used despite the high cost of living in order to improve their earnings.   He said that there is a sufficient amount of fertiliser available and stressed that fertiliser application supports increased production and the health of the plantation. However, the Tea Board is hopeful that there will be an improvement in production, therefore, exports will also improve in response to that. The Tea Board Chair noted that February production based on the indication the Tea Board has, “may show a marginal increase on February last year”. However, it is nothing significant to talk about because February 2022 was “quite a low figure”.    “Tea exports are directly linked to tea production. Tea production dropped in the months of November, December, and January. Those are the closest three months that, perhaps, can be taken that had an impact on the February exports,”  he added.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/yxQkRgwKrxzREtI9N0oJ,21 May 2023 | By Tanya Shan,Banks’ first quarter performance: Varied performance and prospects of recovery,"As the Government slowly unrolls the domestic debt restructuring process through the decision to restructure the Treasury bills owned by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) have issued their quarterly financials as they wrapped up another financial year on 31 March. The financial performance of the banks differed from each other this time. Most banks recorded a profit while the Commercial Bank of Ceylon, Sampath Bank, and Union Bank of Colombo recorded a decline in profits. According to a report issued by Capital Alliance Limited (CAL) on the quarterly performance of banks for Q1 2023, the elevated interest rate environment continued to support Net Interest Income (NII) to grow in the first quarter aided by bank profitability. Sampath Bank  Sampath Bank registered a Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 4.5 billion and a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs. 2.6 billion for the three months ending on 31 March, indicating a decline of 30.5% and 44.3% respectively from the figures reported in the first quarter of 2022. Sampath Bank reported a total interest income of Rs. 50.2 billion in Q1 2023, up by 102% from the Rs. 24.9 billion recorded in the corresponding period of the previous year. The Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPLR) moved up significantly from 9.85% at the end of the first quarter of 2022 to 21.4% at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Because of the higher interest rates that existed throughout the reporting period compared to the preceding period, the bank was able to register a substantial increase in interest income. Bank of CeylonBank of Ceylon has reported Rs. 3.3 billion of PBT for the three-month period ended 31 March amidst the unprecedented challenges that continued to prevail from the previous year.The interest income of the bank grew by 61% to Rs. 137.8 billion, primarily due to the increase in AWPLR compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. However, interest expenses grew by 162% as the funding mix has been repriced at higher rates, resulting high cost of funding and leading to a 53% decline in net interest income by Rs. 21.2 billion compared to Q1 2022, since the bank has not transferred the full impact of the increase in the market interests to its customers in order to revive their businesses in these trying times despite many headwinds to the bank’s current operating environment.Hatton National BankHatton National Bank PLC has posted a PBT of Rs. 10.7 billion, up 80% Year-on-Year (YoY), while PAT stood at Rs. 6.9 billion in the first quarter, growing 42% YoY. The group made a consolidated PBT and PAT of Rs. 11.3 billion and Rs. 7.3 billion respectively. Relatively high interest rates compared to Q1 2022 facilitated the bank to report a net interest income of Rs. 31.6 billion during Q1 2023, reflecting an 87% YoY growth. With higher card volumes coupled with increased adoption of digital services, net fee and commission income grew by 31% YoY to Rs. 4.2 billion. Nations Trust BankNations Trust Bank PLC reported a strong performance in the first three months of 2023, posting a PBT of Rs. 5.8 billion, up 124% YoY and a PAT of Rs. 2.8 billion, up 77% YoY, supported by a 52% growth in operating income.  National Development Bank National Development Bank (NDB) PLC recorded a post-tax profit of Rs. 805 million for the first quarter ended 31 March, a healthy growth of 33% over the same period in 2022. As demonstrated over the years, NDB’s core banking operations posted resilient performance with gross income growing by 75% to Rs. 33.5 billion in the period under review. All income categories grew impressively, with the only exception in other operating income. Net interest income grew by 38% to Rs. 8.5 billion, driven by interest income of Rs. 32.8 billion and interest expenses of Rs. 24.2 billion, which were higher by 113% and 165% respectively over the comparative period. Commercial Bank of CeylonCommercial Bank of Ceylon PLC reported a PBT of Rs. 6.337 billion for the quarter, a drop of 60.61% while PAT for the period was down by 64.57% to Rs. 4.091 billion. The group reported an operating PBT on financial services of Rs. 7.812 billion for the three months, a decline of 60.07%. Taxes on financial services were reduced by 66.03% to Rs. 1.072 billion, resulting in profit before income tax for the period declining by 58.91% to Rs. 6.741 billion. However, the income tax expense for the period was reduced only by 48.56% as a result of an increase in the income tax rate to 30% from 24% for the group’s Sri Lankan operations. Consequently, the group’s net profit of Rs. 4.359 billion represented a decline of 62.98% over the net profit reported for the first quarter of 2022.DFCCDFCC Bank PLC reported a PBT of Rs. 2,684 million and a PAT of Rs. 1,749 million for the quarter ended 31 March. This compares with a PBT of Rs. 143 million and a PAT of Rs. 366 million in the previous period.What the performance of banks indicatesIn a recent conversation, banking industry expert and First Capital Holdings Chief Research and Strategy Officer Dimantha Mathew provided insight into the first quarter financial reports of various banks. He shed light on the overall performance of banks during this period and offered predictions for the upcoming quarters.According to Mathew, the banks had experienced varied outcomes in the first quarter, with some showing substantial profits while others had faced challenges. He explained that the previous year had been marked by banks making provisions for potential haircuts stemming from International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) and the looming threat of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) due to the economic crisis.“While there was considerable profitability last year, this year we anticipate a gradual decline in provisioning as the economy stabilises,” Mathew stated. He emphasised the expectation of a positive GDP growth towards the fourth quarter, indicating a potential recovery of the overall economy. Correspondingly, banks’ profitability is anticipated to improve, primarily due to reduced provisioning requirements compared to the previous year.When discussing the second quarter’s performance, Mathew projected similarities with the first quarter, although he anticipated better results. He noted that certain banks, particularly larger ones such as commercial banks, continued to exercise caution and maintained higher provisioning levels. However, he shared the belief that these requirements would gradually ease over time.“We anticipate a potential recovery becoming evident, as the excessive provisioning made in recent times should not experience reversals this year. However, we might witness provision reversals and a further boost in profitability once the economy is in full swing, potentially in the coming year,” Mathew elaborated.Mathew expressed a more cautious outlook regarding lending activities, suggesting stagnation or even a predominantly negative trend until the last half of the year. He clarified that while the recovery process would commence during the second half, the visible impact of the recovery may only be evident in the final quarter.Mathew’s observations and predictions suggest a mixed performance for banks in the first quarter, with challenges and opportunities lying ahead. As the economy stabilises and progresses, the banking sector is expected to witness improved profitability, potential provision reversals in future, and an instrumental role in overall earnings recovery later in the year.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/q86PY0LDUrwuUi97gpdL,11 Jun 2023 | By Imesh Ranasinghe,Defaulted credit card debt surpasses Rs. 21 b in ’22,"Over 200,000 credit cards have arrears exceeding 90 daysDefaulted credit card value jumps 35% in 2022Interest rate hikes contribute to Rs. 21 b in debtTotal credit card transactions soar; drop in active cardsSri Lanka’s defaulted credit card debt exceeded Rs. 21 billion in the crisis year of 2022 – an increase of 35% compared to 2021, with over 200,000 credit cards having arrears of over 90 days, Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) data showed.According to the CBSL Payment Bulletin, 200,739 credit cards have defaulted in 2022 with a total defaulted value of Rs. 21.2 billion compared to Rs. 15.7 billion in 2021 against the backdrop of credit card annual interest rates going from 18% to 36% in 2022 due to CBSL policy rate hikes.Data showed that 240,653 credit cards were issued during the year, bringing the default to issuance percentage of credit cards to 83% from 60% in 2021, while the number of credit cards in use increased only by 89 to 2,054,896 by the end of 2022 from 2021.However, the total value of credit card transactions in 2022 has increased by about 120% to Rs. 401.7 billion despite an increase of 7.2% (9.1 million) in transaction volumes.Speaking in Parliament last week, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said that the Government expected the new lending rates of banks to drop rapidly with the 250 basis points cut in the policy rates by the CBSL.He noted that the 12-month Treasury bill had received bids three times the value offered at the auction held on Wednesday (7) while yield rates had fallen by 380 basis points. “The demand for the 364-day Treasury bill shows stability in the economy,” he added.Accordingly, at the Treasury bill auction on Wednesday (7), the three-month yield fell by 244 basis points to 23.21% while the six-month and 12-month yield fell by 339 and 381 basis points to 21.90% and 19.10% respectively.The auction received total bids worth Rs. 315.5 billion while accepting Rs. 140 billion.Noting that interest rates on fixed deposits had to come down as a result of the policy rate cut, the State Minister further said that the Government had been able to achieve the targets of its economic stabilisation plan much earlier than expected. “The rapid disinflation trend is one such good indicator,” he added.While salaries and wages have remained static for the majority, average spending has seen a sharp growth over the past year, thanks to the high double-digit rate of inflation in Sri Lanka.Prices of goods and services have almost doubled and in some cases tripled. This impacts a credit card user in various ways. When disposable monthly income is barely sufficient to cover their monthly expenditure, people tend to use credit cards to cover the remaining expenditure. On the other hand, the monthly payment made for the credit card could be lower or equal to what they had been paying every month, not keeping up with the pace of credit card spending, hence running a constant and gradually increasing outstanding balance. In addition to inflation, the newly-imposed direct and indirect taxes have rendered most goods more expensive and further reduced disposable incomes of those who make over Rs. 100,000 per month.Credit card debt is a type of unsecured liability that is incurred through revolving credit card loans. Credit cards are issued with revolving credit limits that borrowers can utilise as needed. There are two types of credit card customers. If cardholders return the money in full every month, they do not have to pay interest. However, if they only make a partial repayment, they will be paying only the amount they can afford or paying the minimum.When someone fails to meet the payment due date, it results in a loss of credibility, as Siam Commercial Bank of Thailand notes.Under such circumstances, the bank changes the person’s status from prime to subprime – commonly termed ‘blacklist’ – and the data is reported to the Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka (CRIB), resulting in a bad financial record and difficulty in requesting loans in the future.The increasing outstanding balance of credit cards amid the declining number of active credit cards indicates a serious and new aspect of growing credit issues among the public.

Bernard said: “Currently, the Ports Authority is  generating a handsome amount of foreign exchange. With the East Container Terminal ready within about half a year, that will definitely increase or expand the capacity of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority by at least about 3 million TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit) per year, and that will most certainly bring much more revenue to the country.”Moreover, In the future, the ECT will bring larger vessels which were not able to come to Colombo in earlier instances, making the Colombo Port one of the the most important and busy hub ports in the region.Compared to 2021, the freight rates, at international-level, have declined because there has been excess capacity in the shipping lines, which has affected the Colombo port as well. According to the Amtrak report, in 2024, they anticipate an annual revenue growth of about 2.4% in the industry.According to SLPA, the said Terminal will be the first semi-automated terminal in the port of Colombo. Mainly, the yard area equipment will be with the latest technology. The new cranes will be about 55 metres high when compared to the old ones which are only 45 to 50 metres high and will be able to reach about 26 boxes.Moreover, a total of $ 585 million has been allocated for the development of the terminal through financial provisions by the SLPA. China Engineering and Access Engineering of Sri Lanka are the appointed construction contractors. He explained that Colombo port, the hub of the region is also looking at the future plans for the port such as construction of the West Container Terminal under the Adani group, and SLPA looks forward to the Colombo North Port development.According to the World Bank and Standard and Poor’s Market Intelligence, Sri Lanka’s Colombo Port has been ranked 22 in the world and first in South Asia in 2022. However, SLPA anticipates being ranked in the 14th position in the next two years,” Bernard said.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/ABeyVP7SffkvLwxyCgpi,14 Jan 2024,Modernising agriculture,"In Sri Lanka, agriculture stands as a cornerstone, woven into the fabric of the nation’s identity and tradition. Yet, as the world advances into the digital age, it is becoming increasingly apparent that Sri Lanka’s agricultural practices have yet to fully harness the transformative power of technology.The traditional agrarian methods that have sustained the island for centuries are undeniably rich in cultural significance. However, with global demands for agricultural produce soaring and the imperative to explore new export avenues, it is high time for Sri Lanka to transcend its entrenched agricultural practices and embrace a technological renaissance.Sri Lanka, often dubbed the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, has been cautious, if not conservative, in adopting modern agricultural technologies. While this inclination can be attributed to the profound respect for heritage and the age-old practices that have sustained the nation, the need for a paradigm shift is becoming increasingly evident.Our South Asian counterparts, such as India and China, have successfully integrated cutting-edge technologies into their agricultural sectors. These countries serve as poignant examples of how technological interventions can enhance yield, streamline operations, and open up new avenues for export. It is imperative that Sri Lanka follows suit, not as a departure from its rich agrarian history, but as a necessary evolution that ensures sustenance and prosperity for the generations to come.The challenges confronting Sri Lanka’s agriculture are multifaceted. From fragmented landholdings to a lack of irrigation infrastructure and inadequate access to modern farming techniques, the hurdles are both intricate and interconnected. However, these challenges should be viewed as opportunities for growth rather than insurmountable barriers.To embark on this transformative journey, the Government must spearhead initiatives aimed at infusing modern know-how and expertise into the local agricultural sector. Educational programmes should be implemented to equip farmers with the latest advancements in farming technologies. Collaborations with international agencies and technology providers can facilitate knowledge transfer and access to state-of-the-art agricultural equipment.Precision agriculture, drone technology, smart irrigation systems, and data analytics are but a few examples of the technological arsenal available to modernise Sri Lanka’s agriculture. These technologies can enhance productivity, reduce resource wastage, and provide real-time insights into crop health and environmental conditions.Moreover, the integration of technology can empower farmers with data-driven decision-making capabilities, enabling them to adapt to changing market dynamics and consumer preferences. Sri Lanka’s produce can be tailored to meet global standards, enhancing its competitiveness on the international stage.The metamorphosis of Sri Lanka’s agriculture is not a departure from its storied past but a strategic evolution essential for ensuring food security, economic prosperity, and global relevance. The Government’s commitment to modernising the agricultural sector is not just a necessity; it is an investment in the nation’s sustainable future. As we draw inspiration from our South Asian peers, we should embark on this journey with a sense of urgency, guided by the wisdom of our traditions and the promise of a technologically empowered tomorrow.

So far, there has not been safe sailing for businesses, meaning that we are not totally out of the doldrums and the business-as-usual environment has not set in. 2022 was an incredibly tough year, and while we have shown agility and resilience, we have not emerged from the doldrums unscathed. The magnitude of the conundrum is still to be determined, but we are acutely aware of the difficulties that lie ahead.He noted that despite the apparent end of the pandemic, exporters were facing another global crisis, compounded by the crippling local financial crisis. The looming economic slowdown in Europe and the USA, their  major export destinations, posed a severe threat to their exports. In addition, the increase in corporate and personal taxes, unfavourable forex rates, and the abnormal increase in the cost of commodities, energy in particular, had caused their  production costs to skyrocket, eroding their global competitiveness.“As a result, our export figures have taken a hit, and many major industrial exporters are downsizing, shutting down operations, or relocating. The SME sector has been particularly hard-hit, with the withdrawal of loan moratoriums and the contraction of large-scale enterprises having a cascading effect. We fervently hope that the authorities will realise the seriousness of the situation and take swift action to prevent mass-scale furloughing, job losses, and closures that will ultimately lead to dwindling foreign income.”Dial Textiles Industries (Pvt.)

The German-built Liebherr brand crane was being used in Japan and has now been imported to Sri Lanka for civil projects. “HIP has earned itself a name for its Roll-in/Roll-out (RORO) capabilities and currently we are aggressively promoting the port’s ability to handle all types of vehicles in the international market. The way this heavy equipment was unloaded at the port is a fine example of HIP’s capability. Heavy equipment coming into the port need not be carried on flat racks, but instead, this was moved via trailers which are driven on and off the respective vessels. This notches up our safety factor as well as minimising any accidents. We believe this changes the equation even in the case of transshipment of such equipment and Hambantota International Port is open for this business,” says Hambantota International Port Group (Pvt.) Ltd. COO Tissa Wickramasinghe. The crawler crane which consisted of 1000 tonnes of components was unloaded by HIP within a day.  The cargo was then transferred to 42 trucks which took the equipment by road in two days to the project site in Mannar for assembling. “HIP is well known for its accident free operations and for maintaining very high standards in health and safety. This is one of the key reasons for the port being a preferred choice when importing heavy equipment that need delicate handling like the crawler crane, which to date is the largest in Sri Lanka. It is the first time Japan exported such a large crane. There are only a few cranes of such capacity in Japan and only three available in the whole of South Asia. We were encouraged when HIP’s marketing team expressed the capabilities of the port, during their visit to Japan, which helped us decide to ship the crane to HIP,” says Rainbow Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/BbxKpRFKR5kziN0OINrq,26 Jan 2023 | By Imesh Ranasinghe,Central Bank Act a must before IMF’s second review,"Governor Nandalal says IMF requires Act enacted between two reviewsSri Lanka will have to enact its new Central Bank Act between the first two reviews of the programme by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), noted Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe during the Committee on Public Finance held on Tuesday (23).The Governor said that with the exception of gaining financial assurance from creditors, the only other pending action required by the IMF to initiate its programme is obtaining Cabinet approval for a new Central Bank Bill.Accordingly, enacting the new Central Bank Act is a requirement laid out by the IMF to unlock the disbursement of funds at the second review in its four-year programme. In an interview with The Sunday Morning Business earlier this month, Dr. Weerasinghe said that the Central Bank Bill, which was drafted between 2018 and 2019 under former Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, will be brought back as the Central Bank Act with new changes incorporated based on the experiences over the past few years.He said that a key provision in the newly proposed Central Bank Act is the prohibition imposed on the Central Bank against the direct purchase of Treasury bills to finance the fiscal deficit, Dr. Weerasinghe highlighted. In addition to this, the Act also allows the Central Bank to recognise macroprudential policies and set up a separate establishment for public debt management. Although according to the original Bill, the CBSL is prohibited from issuing credit to the Government or any organisation owned by the Government, this prohibition does not apply to Government- or publicly-owned banks and other financial institutions, as the CBSL is the last-resort lender to the financial sector.Further, in terms of money printing, the original Bill states that in order to operate an inflation-targeting framework successfully, the Central Bank should be able to control the stock of money effectively, as the liquidity level affects inflation. Thus, the Bill would restrict the provisional advances to 10% of Government revenue for the first four months of the preceding financial year, whereas the current Monetary Law allows up to 10% of the estimated Government revenue for the whole year.

Sri Lanka got into trouble during Covid-19 with public debt at 70% of GDP. Sri Lanka's fiscal position is on most metrics worse than Zambia's. It historically has collected less revenue as a percentage of the GDP,” he said.Sri Lanka has collected on average tax revenues of 12% of GDP in the ten years before the pandemic, while Zambia on average collected over 18% of GDP in revenue.Moreover, he said that Sri Lanka's $ 13.4 billion external bondholders ($1.5 billion of which seem to be held domestically) may get greedy and seek to preserve both face value and coupon during the restructuring even though their bonds trade in the 30s in the secondary market.Setser noted that it would be a big mistake and added that such restructuring may be allowed by the IMF's unbelievably soft criteria of 4.5% of GDP per year in foreign debt servicing, which allows a high coupon if maturities are pushed beyond 2032.“But it has enormous risks for the bonds. Sri Lanka's debt wouldn't be sustainable (at least not with a high probability, no matter what the IMF says), and the debt overhang and risk of default would assure the bonds trade at a big discount to par,” he said. He proposes a win-win on the table rather than maximising within the IMF's soft terms where  $ 13.4 billion in old bonds (including arrears) are replaced by $ 7 billion (or $ 6.7 billion = half face value) in new bonds, and raising the average coupon rate from 6% to 8%.He added that at a 10% exit yield, the new bonds (assumed to mature in 2032) would be worth 45 cents on the current dollar – well above where Sri Lanka's bonds have traded recently under 30 at one stage.“in NPV terms, using the LIC (Low-Income Countries) 5% discount, this is a 40% haircut as well, so it is a real concession, bond holders would be giving up upside (lower par, limiting future gains) for a lot of downside protection, the 8% coupon protects against the Federal Reserve Interest rates or high emerging market spreads,” he said.He noted that he is convinced the basic idea is to sound more like a haircut on the principal amount of a bond, for a higher coupon that will help support the secondary market for the new bond and “add to the odds that when the bond matures Sri Lanka can refinance at a lower rate,” he added.Setser said that the bondholders would gain immense credibility by recognising that the IMF's stock constraint is too loose and doesn't assure sustainability and offering to do more than the minimum required.“And it should be noted, at reasonable exit yields even bonds that have a 50% or so principal haircut should trade above the current value of Sri Lanka's defaulted debt,” he said.

Why not focus on the confectionery industry when we have the potential to do so. We (Government) are in the midst of discussions to grant lands in Matale, Kandy, Mawathagama, Dodangaslanda only for local companies and local companies with foreign shareholders to intercrop with cocoa”.He added that it is not only to improve the harvest but also for confectionery manufacturing.President Wickremesinghe also said that the Government is in the process of having discussions with the Governments of Ivory Coast and Ghana to receive cocoa for plantation. Morver, Sri Lanka is in negotiations with India for the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) said the President elaborating that customs duty is a concern as removal of such will provide Sri Lanka a bigger global market share for trading.  “We have already allocated capital of Rs. 8 billion for research (for confectionery industry development) since we need an (export-oriented) industry,” he elaborated. In addition, President Wickremesinghe awarded eight local manufacturers who contribute largely towards domestic consumption and LCMA President Prof. Samitha Perera also presented a souvenir to President Wickremesinghe. According to the World Population Review, Cote d’Ivoire is responsible for 30% of the world’s cocoa while brands like Cadbury and Nestle mostly source their cocoa from this country. Ghana is such a top producer of cocoa. However, its operational costs have become a problem in recent years, leading to cocoa smuggling to the Ivory Coast. Indonesia is relatively new to the cocoa industry. Other nations that are top producers of cocoa include Brazil, Cameroon, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Nigeria, and Peru.

For this, the company is investing more than $ 3.6 million in the first phase.The signing of the relevant agreement was done by Sri Lanka Board of Investment (BOI) Chairman Dinesh Weerakkoddy, and Director Dr. Rohan Fernando, on behalf of Aitken Spence.Lushan Perera, the company's chief executive officer, says that this factory, which is operating under a new vision, will generate substantial new job opportunities, and it will expand further. He also said that steps have been taken to start the production process within two months.Speaking further, Perera said that given the ongoing global economic crisis, his company's hope is to focus on competitive products and find new markets, and for that, he will pay more attention to the markets of emerging Asian countries such as India, China, Indonesia, and Japan.Priyanka Ranatunga, director of the Koggala Investment Processing Zone of Sri Lanka Board of Investments, said that at present, a workforce of about 11,000 in the Koggala region is responsible for earning foreign exchange, and with the opening of new factories, that number may increase to 13,500, and in addition, a large number of indirect jobs will also be created. He said that it is predicted that the existing shortfall in price orders will be restored by the end of the year and the necessary empowerment of the factories will be done accordingly.Due to the closure of the said two factories, about 2500 people who were making a living lost their jobs due to this. The value of the machinery of these factories located in the Koggala Investment Processing Zone is hundreds of millions of US dollars.

Several new categories have been added, including warehousing and logistics, electrical and electronics, mineral products, automobile manufacturing, apparel and textiles, petroleum and oil-related products, pharmaceuticals, rubber products, furniture, and food production, etc. according to HIP’s Master Plan.This expansion follows in the wake of the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) granting a “Supplemental Initial Environmental” Examination (SIEE) approval to HIP, which includes the consent of the Board of Investment (BOI),​​ Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), CCD, Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), and several other government agencies, allowing the necessary environment blanket extension that will enable these new categories of industrial clusters to enter the industrial park. “Besides providing industries easy access to port services, our port-park model also makes it easy for cargo imports and exports to take place, providing them with a range of facilities. Under our ‘HIP Speed’ concept, we assist them to get necessary government approvals as well as be involved in the setup and operation of their businesses. Through the expansion of industrial cluster categories that can operate within the park, we will strengthen our position as a partner in Sri Lanka’s development by bringing global industries to operate on Lankan soil. This ‌will no doubt boost Sri Lanka’s export earnings,” said Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG) CEO Johnson Liu . Accordingly, Government agencies have made several inspection visits and HIP conducted comprehensive field and technical studies on the port’s baseline environment prior to approval being granted. Introduction of new common user facilities and necessary infrastructure are also factored in and the port will soon align with parametres set by government regulations and monitored by relevant institutions, to accommodate a broader range of industries. These industrial clusters will take advantage of the multipurpose port’s unique location as well as the expert services it offers within a well-established industrial park. The Port Investment Services division of HIPG, which is committed to promoting investments for the park, will soon spearhead a promotional campaign that will attract more potential global partners.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/gkSgWwCKkemMKNyQQG9t,03 Oct 2023 | BY Imesh Ranasinghe,Import ban lifted to address IMF revenue concerns,"Relaxation of all import restrictions is to address the revenue shortfall concern raised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said.Speaking to TV Derana on Sunday (1), The subject minister said that Sri Lankan authorities are looking to find alternate measures to address the revenue shortfall concern of the IMF programme, as the first review discussions of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) between the two parties continue. “Once we relax import restrictions by next month (November), we will be able to get additional revenue,” he said, highlighting the fact that the restrictions on vehicle importation will not be relaxed at present. Last week, at the IMF mission press conference in Colombo, IMF Mission Chief Peter Breuer said that there is no fixed timeline for disbursing the second tranche, as two important issues have to be sorted out with the Sri Lankan authorities, such as the tax reforms and policies to achieve the 2024 tax target and a clear path on Sri Lanka’s external debt restructuring process.Further, the statement issued by the IMF said that although the authorities have met the programme’s primary balance targets and remain committed to this important pillar of the programme so as to support their efforts to restore debt sustainability, revenue mobilisation gains – while improved relative to last year – are expected to fall short of initial projections by nearly 15% by year-end, in part due to economic factors. The IMF recommended that it is important to strengthen tax administration, remove tax exemptions, and actively eliminate tax evasion to increase revenue and signal better governance.Further, State Minister Semasinghe said that the Government has not achieved the required tax base enhancement as anticipated and added that the Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) system of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) will be further strengthened by upgrading the system within the next couple of weeks to eliminate human interaction between the tax authorities and the taxpayers. “Once we are done with these measures, we will get the anticipated revenue because the downtrend of the government revenue was one of the key concerns of the economic crisis,” he said.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/UfYbST6qyGZBwjaURazs,06 Oct 2023,Optimistic on econ. growth in 2024: Nalin Fernando,"Minister of Trade, Commerce and Food Security Nalin Fernando expressed optimism about the country’s economic prospects during a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre on Wednesday (4).He stated that with the Government’s efforts to reduce economic contraction, there is a possibility of achieving a robust economic growth rate of 1.8% to 1.9% in 2024. The Minister highlighted that the Government’s prudent policy decisions in the previous year have led to a significant economic recovery and brought inflation down to single digits. Speaking on the theme of “Collective path to a stable country” Minister Nalin Fernando shared these positive developments.Regarding ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), he mentioned: “We are currently in discussions for the second tranche of the IMF program. In our recent talks with the IMF, we focused on meeting the goals they set for us. Although there were some delays in generating state revenue, the government has diligently worked on it and implemented various policy decisions with effective leadership.”Fernando emphasised the importance of taking necessary steps to reduce economic contraction and transition to a more prosperous economy in 2024. He noted: “According to current forecasts, achieving a financial economic growth rate of 1.8% to 1.9% in 2024 is possible. One of the key objectives of our economic policy program was to address the high cost of living for consumers.” Furthermore, he highlighted their success in reducing food inflation from 94% to -5.1%, a development that some had doubted could occur so quickly. He attributed the country’s economic recovery to the Government’s sound policies.In addition, the Minister pointed out that the reduction in bank interest rates, which had previously soared to 30-32%, now reduced to 15%-16%, has relieved significant pressure on entrepreneurs and traders, leading to improved economic efficiency in the country. “One of the significant challenges we faced during the economic crisis was the prohibition of various imported goods, which caused disruptions in international trade. These restrictions not only posed difficulties for international trade but also created challenges for domestic manufacturers.Our production isn’t solely for domestic consumption but also for export. When crucial raw materials couldn’t be imported due to restrictions, it hindered our production activities, impacting both national production and a decline in export earnings. The topic of which imports to permit received significant attention in recent cabinet meetings. Consequently, we are presently taking measures to lift import restrictions on items other than vehicles. As for vehicle imports, decisions have been made to allow those necessary for public transport and production activities.Efforts are also underway to ease restrictions on vehicle imports, with a keen focus on our policy framework. In light of the recent economic crisis, during which companies made substantial profits while the public suffered, the government is committed to making decisions that prevent such situations from recurring in the future.”

The CCC said it looks forward to similar assurances from other commercial and bilateral creditors including China, in line with IMF requirements that would result in a swift approval of the IMF programme. The Chamber appreciated the support given by China in the economic development of Sri Lanka and requested that they work with the IMF in order for Sri Lanka to receive its much-needed funding as a key bilateral creditor.  The securing of the IMF programme is to be a crucial first step in Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring efforts which will reduce the present economic uncertainty. However, the Government has carried out an initial set of reforms and the Chambers noted they expect more reforms to take place post-IMF Board approval, which will provide an impetus towards economic revival. The Ceylon Chamber also urged the IMF to consider the assurances received thus far and initiate the approval process, as continual delays will place Sri Lanka in an extremely vulnerable social and economic position.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/rWjs2PYmI2npFNKszJqW,22 Sep 2023,Countries can tap tax potential to finance development goals,"Emerging market and low-income economies have a significant untapped tax potential of 8-9% of GDPEmerging markets and developing economies need $ 3 trillion annually through 2030 to finance their development goals and the climate transition. That amounts to about 7% of these countries’ combined 2022 gross domestic product (GDP) and poses a formidable challenge, particularly for low-income countries.New International Monetary Fund (IMF) research finds that many countries have the potential to increase their tax-to-GDP ratios – enabling them to provide critical government services – by as much as 9 percentage points through better tax design and stronger public institutions. Making use of this potential would also contribute to financial development and private sector entrepreneurship. Easier financing, in turn, together with efficient and well-targeted spending, including to strengthen social safety nets, would go a long way toward delivering sustainable development.Stalled progressThe average tax-to-GDP ratio in emerging market and developing economies has increased by about 3.5-5 percentage points since the early 1990s, driven primarily by taxes on consumption such as value-added and excise taxes.Some countries have been remarkably successful in raising revenue, such as Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Brazil, Colombia, and Georgia – all of which mobilised more than 5 percentage points of GDP. Much of this increase occurred before the 2008 global financial crisis, however, suggesting that progress has been difficult and fragile in the face of recent shocks.Moreover, progress on raising revenue since the early 1990s has varied widely across countries. Half of emerging market economies and two-thirds of low-income countries had a tax-to-GDP ratio in 2020 that was lower than 15% – a tipping point above which growth has been found to accelerate. And resource-rich countries have typically generated less tax revenue, as some governments reduced taxes as a result of higher revenue from natural resources.Countries have considerable room to collect more revenue based on their tax potential – the maximum a country can collect given its economic structure and institutions. The IMF finds that low-income countries could raise their tax-to-GDP ratio by as much as 6.7 percentage points on average.Improving public institutions, including reducing corruption, to the level of those in emerging market economies would result in an additional 2.3-point increase. The total revenue-raising potential, at 9 percentage points of GDP – a staggering two-thirds increase relative to their tax-to-GDP ratio in 2020 – would go a long way toward enabling the state to play its crucial role in development.Similarly, emerging market economies can raise their tax-to-GDP ratio by 5 percentage points on average, while improving their institutions to the average of advanced economies could raise an additional 2 to 3 points.Some policymakers hope for additional revenue from the ongoing international collaboration on taxing profits of large multinational corporations. But the direct revenue impact of this initiative is likely to represent only a tiny fraction of the overall revenue needs, as shown in a February policy paper.Essential reformsTo build tax capacity, governments will need to take a holistic and institution-based approach that focuses on leveraging core domestic tax policies. The IMF offers the following concrete advice:Improve the design and administration of core domestic taxes – value-added taxes (VAT), excises, personal income taxes, and corporate income taxes. VAT revenue in low-income countries, for instance, could be doubled by limiting preferential treatments and improving compliance without increasing standard tax rates. And the widespread adoption of digital technologies would result in higher revenue collection and narrow compliance gaps.Implement bold reform plans and focus on tax base broadening through the rationalisation of tax expenditures, more neutral taxation of capital income, and better use of property taxes. Headline tax rates are generally not the main concern. Excise taxes – particularly fuel excises and forms of carbon pricing – can mitigate domestic health and climate-related costs. This multi-pronged approach, over the long term, can balance equity and efficiency considerations – the Achilles’ heel of managing the political economy of tax reforms.Improve the institutions that govern the tax system and manage tax reform. The political economy of tax reform has proven to be hard. Policymakers need evidence to convince the public of the gains and show progress in policy implementation over time. This requires adequate staffing to forecast and analyse the impact of tax policies on the economy, greater professionalisation of public officials working on tax design and implementation, better use of digital technologies to strengthen compliance, and transparency and certainty in how policy and administration are translated into legislation.Carefully prioritise and coordinate reforms across government agencies, because the broader institutional context matters. This creates a virtuous circle by which enhanced institutions improve state capacity, which in turn increases the quality of tax design and its acceptance by citizens. This is, in a nutshell, the IMF’s approach to supporting countries in tax system reform and raising domestic revenue.(IMF Blog)

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/T3lKUP6FUpIHTD74Y4g8,11 Feb 2024,Consumers in a pickle,"Veggie prices and unaffordability crisis Sri Lanka has experienced a surge in vegetable prices, which have reached unprecedented levels in recent times. With Rs. 2,000 fetching only a small handful of vegetables, the stark reality is evident even in the size of the bag they’re carried in – often light enough to lift with just one hand, unless heavy items such as coconuts are included in the purchase, of course. Prompted by these developments, ‘Market Mine’ conducted a comparative analysis of vegetable prices and other essential commodities in both developing and developed countries, factoring in their respective GDP per capita income.GDP per capita, a factor to considerPer capita income simply means the average income earned by a person in a specific area, such as a country or region in a given year. It is calculated by dividing the total income generated in that area by the total population. In simpler terms, it gives an idea of how much money, on average, each person makes in a particular place.According to World Bank statistics, Singapore boasted a GDP per capita income of $ 82,807 in 2022, while Sri Lanka lagged significantly behind at $ 3,354. This staggering gap amounts to $ 79,453, approximately Rs. 24.8 million. Similarly, the disparity between Sri Lanka and Malaysia stands at about Rs. 2.7 million. The discrepancy between Sri Lanka and developed countries like Australia, Switzerland, and the UAE is even more pronounced.However, despite these economic disparities, the prices of vegetables in Sri Lanka are either higher or comparable to those in the developed and developing world. This raises serious questions about the affordability of these essential goods, especially considering the growing poverty levels in Sri Lanka. Many are already being pushed below the poverty line with both direct and indirect taxes and the high cost of living, making it increasingly difficult for them to afford these basic necessities.Sri Lanka’s poverty levels As highlighted by this column recently, a survey conducted by the Colombo-based think tank LIRNEasia in mid-2023 unveiled a concerning reality: Sri Lanka’s poverty-stricken population had surged to a staggering seven million, up from three million in 2019. This alarming statistic represents approximately 31% of the total population.It’s important to note that these figures only reflect data up to mid-last year. Since then, the economic landscape has undergone significant shifts, particularly with regard to the pricing of goods and services. While inflation has moderated from its peak levels in 2022 and 2023, there has been little to no noticeable decrease in prices.Impact of rising vegetable prices  The recent surge in vegetable prices in Sri Lanka has underscored a critical issue – the affordability of basic necessities for the average Sri Lankan. With the cost of vegetables reaching unprecedented levels, households are facing increasing financial strain, further exacerbated by broader economic challenges facing the country.The impact of rising vegetable prices extends beyond individual households to broader socioeconomic dynamics. As evidenced by recent surveys, the number of people living below the poverty line in Sri Lanka has surged, reflecting the growing challenge of affordability for vulnerable segments of society.Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, Advocata Institute Economic Researcher Rehana Thowfeek stated that one of the primary reasons for this price escalation was the shortage in domestic supply. Factors such as adverse weather conditions, pest infestations, and disruptions in agricultural production have significantly impacted the local harvest. Despite these challenges, there has been a notable absence of proactive measures to supplement the shortfall with imported goods.Thowfeek emphasised on the importance of addressing the supply gap by facilitating imports of vegetables. She highlighted that while global prices may be high, it was imperative for Sri Lanka to explore avenues for importing vegetables to meet domestic demand. “The Government should provide the private sector with the necessary incentives and clearance to engage in vegetable imports. One such measure could involve reducing or removing tariffs on imported vegetables, making them more affordable for consumers.”Additionally, Thowfeek pointed out that Sri Lanka had several Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with countries known for their agricultural prowess, however, the inclusion of vegetables in the negative list of these agreements meant that tariff benefits did not extend to this crucial commodity. To leverage the potential of these FTAs and alleviate the pressure on domestic supply, Thowfeek advocated for revisiting trade policies to include vegetables in the list of tariff-benefiting items.By facilitating imports, removing tariff barriers, and leveraging existing trade agreements, the country can mitigate the adverse effects of supply shortages and ensure greater affordability and accessibility of vegetables for its citizens.

Such assessment would help provide greater clarity to all stakeholders on the thinking of the Monetary Board when arriving at monetary policy decisions.The Central Bank said it would publish the MPR in January and July each year in line with the major monetary policy review cycles that update medium-term projections.In doing so, the Central Bank would provide data-driven and forward-looking information to all stakeholders in a timely manner.

The reports will also be made available on the EDB website for the benefit of the public.Currently, more than 6,000 products are eligible for zero-duty access to the EU region under the EU GSP+ scheme. Sri Lanka exported $ 2,948 million worth of goods to the EU region in 2021, which contributed for 24% of Sri Lanka’s total export earnings, amounting to $ 12.2 billion in 2021. Sri Lanka has the potential to expand its market share by entering into new/untapped markets, while enjoying zero-duty market access, as offered by the EU GSP+ scheme.

We have to have a larger production for us to export more tea. More tea you export, the more revenue you get.”    He further added that during the first 10 months of 2023, Tea Board could achieve over $ 800 million in revenue which is a $ 110 million a month average in terms of foreign exchange earnings.  “We also exported 11.6 million kg  (in 2023) figures behind 2022 during those first 10 months. However, production wise, we are 4  million kg ahead in 2023 of the same 10 months compared to 2022.”However, Hayleys Group Managing Director and Planters’ Association (PA) of Ceylon Spokesperson Dr. Roshan Rajadurai recently told The Daily Morning Business that VAT has, in fact, cost of production as tea production inputs such as fuel, machinery, energy, chemicals and materials have increased. At the same time, there are opportunities for Ceylon Tea in the global market,  such as India anticipates to increase its domestic tea consumption which eventually results in India leaving the traditional Western and Russian countries from tea exporting. Sri Lanka can reap from such market situations, PA spokesperson further explained.  Moreover, the Sri Lanka Tea Board Chair said that the application for Geographical Indication (GI) certification for Ceylon Tea within European Union (EU) countries could be submitted by February, “hopefully”.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/vYhzdZgZKshOMHWPboMu,17 Dec 2023 | By Dr. Lakmini Fernando,Public investment for SDG financing: Reality or myth?,"SL needs additional investment of $ 1.4 t by 2030 to achieve SDGsRealising Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 requires substantial investment allocation, especially for developing economies like Sri Lanka. A recent IPS study found that Sri Lanka needs an additional investment of $ 1.4 trillion or 12.5 percentage points of GDP by 2030 to achieve SDGs. Despite Budget 2024 allocating 5.4% of GDP for public investment, concerns arise due to the historical average of 3.4% of GDP during 2022-2023. SDG financing challengesDebt repayment commitments, widening primary deficits, and poor domestic resource mobilisation will collectively make development financing a daunting task. Scantiness in SDG financing is not unique to Sri Lanka. Despite its undeniable importance, SDGs have never received adequate financial support on a global basis.  Fiscal policy is said to be more influential in advanced economies where public investment and tax revenue increase with per capita incomes. However, the role played by public investment in developing economies cannot be overlooked, as it stimulates economic activity and attracts private investments to the country.  In overcoming the SDG financing gap, Sri Lanka could look for non-debt creating alternative financing mechanisms like blended financing, international tax reforms, globally earmarked taxes, increased official development assistance, and giving pledges. As governance quality positively correlates with investment inflow, attempts to improve governance by combating corruption and increasing transparency would enhance Sri Lanka’s eligibility to receive these funds. Sri Lanka needs ‘positive changes’Capturing socio-economic underdevelopment: In general, the advanced economies are closer to achieving SDGs than any other country group. According to the SDG index that measures the overall SDG performance, Sri Lanka recorded an above-world average score of 0.72 and 0.16 before and after the pandemic. Considering the severity of multiple crises, this progress creates much ambiguity on the sensitivity of SDG monitoring and reporting mechanisms. If we are to capture true development challenges, the existing systems might need serious modifications. Sustainable investment: Advanced economies spend the most on education and health. On average, education and health spending in advanced countries lies at 5.2% and 7.8% of GDP in 2019, while the same for Sri Lanka is only 1.9% and 1.6%, respectively. Sri Lanka’s public investment ratio in the three pillars of sustainability – economic, social, and environment – is 80:19:1. Of which, physical infrastructure development attracts the largest investment share. These discrepancies are even visible in the Budget 2024. A single ministry, the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation, and National Policies, receives 62% of total capital expenditure while only the balance 39% is shared among 29 other line ministries, including health, education, and environment (Figure 1). Investment spending does not necessarily support productive asset accumulation due mainly to the weak institutions and corrupt bureaucracies in developing countries. Bureaucrats falsely report high-quality, high-cost procurement, while providing low-quality and low-cost products. Thus, public investment quality declines while spending continues to escalate. To enhance public investment quality, it is essential to deviate from usual practices and adopt positive changes: create a culture of evidence-based policy formulation, establish a science-based project proposal appraisal system, restrict budgetary financing to priority projects, strengthen monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, feed project evaluation findings to development project appraisals, and maintain healthy work ethics that recognise the development needs of the country.  Maintaining stable public institutions: Frequent institutional changes and duplication of institutions can reduce work efficiency while increasing resource wastage. Instead, continuous capacity improvement in the public sector and establishing healthy work ethics will be more influential in bringing positive development change.  Introducing development transformations: The crises create an opportunity to introduce development transformations. For instance, poor maintenance increases rehabilitation and replacement costs by 50-60% in the transportation and water and sanitation sectors. Hence, rather than implementing new projects, asset maintenance would be more cost-effective. Yet, maintenance budgets are always underfunded. By building sectoral expertise in line ministries and Local Governments, bringing meaningful improvements to existing workflow would become much easier.SDGs: A framework of hopeSri Lanka intends to become a developed country by 2048. In designing the national development framework, SDGs could be used as a foresight planning tool to support this vision. In doing so, mainstreaming SDGs into the national development agenda and extending 2030 targets to match national development goals would be the first steps.  The technical and financial assistance that comes with SDGs should be used for qualitative improvements in almost all development sectors and the capacity enhancement of the public sector. Therefore, the understanding of policymakers and development practitioners on the nature and the level of change is pivotal. In solving the development puzzle, the use of external knowledge and expertise should be focused on improving the local talent to avoid over-dependence.   A broader vision that goes beyond the ‘western suburbs’ is imperative in achieving the SDGs’ core objectives that bring inclusive and sustainable development. This will be a success if the development vision speaks a common language that comprehends the needs of both the rich and the poor in an equitable way. Subsequently, choosing a long-term sustainable development trajectory over short-sighted popular economic gains would eventually enhance the quality of life for all.(The writer is a Research Fellow at IPS with primary research interest in development economics, public finance, and climate change.

Furthermore, it appears that most investors are looking to cash in at the end of the year. It is normal for funds, foreigners, and also individual investors to cash in during the end of the year in the lead-up to the holiday season, where there will be increased spending.”Commenting on the net foreign foreign investor inflows observed in the market, Mathew stated that this was largely related to the share buyback of EXPO by its parent company and that there were no significant foreign inflows observed in any of the other counters. During the past two weeks, the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has witnessed significant bloodletting as investor sentiments turned south with the increasing likelihood that Sri Lanka would be unable to secure IMF Executive Board approval by end December 2022 as previously promised by the Government. As a result, most of the gains in November were wiped out.Consequently, the benchmark All Share Price Index fell from its high of 8,891.74 points observed on 8 December 2022 to below 8,500 points.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/nH4OTSrqoJ5QmDQpkGYt,17 Dec 2023 | By Viraj Jayasooriya,Making your manufacturing count,"Manufacturing operations in Sri Lanka have faced repeated crises in recent years, starting with the Easter attacks, followed by Covid-19 and then the unprecedented economic collapse. Each crisis brought with it different challenges, which had to be navigated to optimise built infrastructure such as factories, machinery, and people. The emerging challenges ranged from a lack of orders to difficulty in importing raw materials and unfavourable exchange rates – all scenarios which were of crisis proportions. Companies with a long-term vision, which were adhering to sound environmental, social, and good governance frameworks, not only coped through the multiple crises but actually thrived. As a futuristic company, Hemas possesses strong leadership backed by a value-driven culture, which implies that the company doesn’t compromise the long-term for immediate short-term gains. As a result, companies with a similar vision, which have been investing in building brands with good value propositions for years, witnessed strong brand loyalty during the economic crisis. Steeped in the manufacturing field for the last 20 years, I believe Sri Lanka lacks what is called a competitive advantage in manufacturing when it comes to cost competitiveness, as we lack local availability of raw materials and commodities, with local inputs being associated with inefficient sources at times. However, in terms of developing competitive advantage (not the comparative advantage) we are not deficient in resources, but lack basic building blocks of envisioning, passion, and longer-term strategies.Hence, this country’s manufacturing sector has a greater chance of creating a competitive advantage by adopting world-class best practices such as lean manufacturing, cleaner production, operational excellence frameworks, and technology through which you provide innovative solutions to fast-changing customer needs quickly, at the lowest cost, and with sustained quality. Adopting some of these practices can help build a platform of ‘doing more with less’. Empirical data reveals that this supports doubling the output at half the input cost of your conversion, making you better, cheaper, and faster to the market. Moreover, Sri Lanka needs a visionary longer-term solution for manufacturing, because location and cheap inputs need not always be an advantage. Today, companies are shifting manufacturing bases with ease – China’s focus shifted to Vietnam and then to Bangladesh, and soon it will move to Africa. The companies of tomorrow must compete on the basis of innovation. Without the advantage of having economies of scale, Sri Lanka must build its innovation quotient and ethical manufacturing reputation to maintain a distinctive edge. This should include an end-to-end quality management system starting from supplier to the final product, assuring quality and a seamless operation. ‘Highest quality at the lowest price’ should be our goal. Inculcating a ‘first-time quality culture’ significantly reduces the cost structure while improving trust with your customers. In essence, this philosophy transforms your hidden factory into an open factory and eliminates the ‘cost of poor quality’ of every single point of the supply chain. Focusing on ‘quality at source’ of your value chain can make a critical difference.Further, in this part of the world, we tend to be heavily reliant on people so there is an urgent need to make a paradigm shift from people dependency to system dependency. The best way to achieve this is by adopting best practices and starting from being brilliant at basics, which includes standardising systems and processes while being up to date with technology. This should be topped off with an encouraging and supportive workplace environment where employee contribution is genuinely valued and respected. Furthermore, supply chain resilience is another key pillar of a strong manufacturing base. Companies that adopted best management practices continued smooth logistical operations with minimal disruption. Creating additional resources of critical components in manufacturing assures streamlined operations in case of external disasters. At Hemas, we have established a Risk and Control function which monitors all functions for its risk appetite. Another important pillar for a strong manufacturing legacy is a caring and positive work environment for employees, which in turn inspires them to make a tremendous contribution towards the company. Going green is another way of building a distinctive identity. A green supply chain is about connecting the surrounding ecosystem with every area of the supply chain with the utmost responsibility that promises a better tomorrow. This would include responsible sourcing, reducing wastage in the manufacturing process, ensuring lower emissions, a circular economy, ethical human resources practices that do not exploit workers, optimising transport, and the responsible use of plastics. Ultimately, companies should embrace extended producer responsibility and move towards zero plastics.Another possibility is to create agility and flexibility to ensure speed to market with nano plants which produce small quantities at the same or a lesser price compared to mass production by heavily adopting end-to-end lean processes backed by advanced technologies such as machine learning, IoT, artificial intelligence, etc.Industry 4.0 is also dictating trends in manufacturing and refers to the current era of connectivity, advanced analytics, automation, and advanced-manufacturing technology. This revolution holds significant potential for the future of manufacturing and it would be foolish to ignore it.Finally, supply chain resilience can be built by being proactive instead of reactive. Also, do not seek ‘cheap’ people costs, which merely lend short-term benefits. For a sustained performance, transform people by exposing them to best practices, offer insights, and train them with an entrepreneurial mindset so they will do the magic of ‘doing more with less’. Despite all the technology in the world, the human touch is also needed, so nurture those strong stakeholder relationships and connect with your communities. (The writer joined Hemas Consumer Brands as Director – Manufacturing.

But right now, they (the said committee) have not yet finalised the matter.”Badugama explained that till the drafted policy framework is submitted to the Government, the cultivation of cannabis cannot proceed since the policy framework currently being drafted is what will provide the necessary guidelines for the commencement of the industry. The Daily Morning Business reported in June 2023 that the EDB was exploring potential markets for the exportation of medicinal cannabis.Speaking to The Daily Morning in October 2022, Minister of Justice Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe (PC) said: “There is a committee appointed within Parliament to draft the policy. We cannot draft a Bill without a policy.”Dr. Rajapkshe explained that the relevant laws are necessary to be in place for the cultivation of medicinal cannabis in a separate zone with fully-fledged security for the sole purpose of exportation.He reiterated: “We also have to see if it is viable. Currently, there is heavy competition for the hemp industry in the world. The profit is not as before due to competition. We will have to consider all these factors and thereafter, if we decide on the policy, only then will we consider drafting the law.” Speaking to the media following the Cabinet paper submission in this regard, State Minister of Indigenous Medicine Sisira Jayakody stressed that cannabis grown for medical purposes, in fact, cannot be used for smoking. According to the agreement that has been signed with the United Nations (UN), Sri Lanka is only able to cultivate cannabis for medical and scientific purposes. According to the US-based Mayo Clinic, a globally renowned  health centre, medicinal marijuana is used for treating diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), HIV/AIDS, Crohn’s disease, epilepsy and seizures, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis and muscle spasms, severe and chronic pain, and severe nausea or vomiting caused by cancer treatment. However, its use could cause possible side effects such as increased heart rate, dizziness, impaired concentration and memory, slower reaction times, negative drug-to-drug interactions, increased risk of heart attack and stroke, increased appetite, potential for addiction, hallucinations, or mental illness and withdrawal symptoms.

Impressed by his feat, I and my colleague from The Sunday Morning met the entrepreneurial legend for a chat.Your achievement is impressive. Can we know how it happened?The answer is simple – all my objectives are achieved through strategic leadership. Without strategic leadership, companies have a weak foundation and as the business grows, there is no strong structure rooted to the ground to prevent things from caving in. Strategic leadership happens when a leader shares a vision and a goal with his team and inspires them to work together to reach it. A strategic leader often acts as the motivating force for an organisation, letting individuals know their role in achieving the vision. This leadership style helps others have direction at all times. Tell us about your business grouping and its impactful features.We have five enterprises that are benchmarks in their respective spheres. K & D Management Services (Pvt) Ltd. is the oldest firm with a 17-year legacy. It was established in 2006 as a debt recovery company for banks and finance companies. We have an islandwide debt recovery network and we work very closely with 10 leading banks and six financial companies which include both local as well as international banks and we undertake their debt collections relating to credit cards and loans. K & D Management Services also has a subsidiary company named K & D Holdings (Pvt) Ltd., which is an outsourced company dealing with handling sales. The company’s debt collections are done once a client sends a monthly portfolio which is distributed to the collectors stationed islandwide, who report to the company’s Head Office on a regular basis.Our debt collectors use the latest technologies for debt collection, where every transaction is updated through a computerised network. We don’t practise any unethical methods relating to debt recoveries and instead apply marketing techniques to educate people and encourage them to make the required payments.K & D Foods International (Pvt) Ltd. is our food processing company located in Homagama. We process and distribute premium quality Super Sun branded sausages, ham, sandwiches, soya ice cream, and a range of tongue-teasing and mouth-watering desserts.K & D Investment & Realty (Pvt) Ltd. specialises in buying and selling land. The company adheres to a corporate philanthropic ideology where really needy people become beneficiaries of financial assistance.K & D Travels & Tours (Pvt) Ltd. are experts in ticketing and in inbound and outbound travel and tour operations. How are your companies so strong and so resilient against adversities?It is once again due to my prudent strategies. During the Covid and post-Covid periods, a lot of small and medium enterprises ran short of funds and there were many closures of businesses. There was rampant unemployment as a result. However, none of our employees lost their jobs nor were they starving in their homes, purely because of my farsightedness. My strategy was to cultivate a ‘safe side’ – be thrifty or spend sparingly and increase savings. This strategy paid off handsomely when we were able to expand our business activities in 2020.We did well in 2020. However, it became very rough somewhere around April 2021. There were eight to 12-hour power cuts and there were no dollars in banks and these bombshells had a devastating effect on our companies. Our raw material imports were on the verge of collapse. Nevertheless, due to my master strategies and farsightedness, I had imported and stored necessities for months before the calamity affected us. I was also able to import raw materials in limited quantities purely due to the relationships I had built painstakingly over the years with commercial bankers. We didn’t wait till the last moment but restructured our loans no sooner we had an opportunity to do so. There were many prudent cost minimising steps adopted by us, such as remote office work and Zoom meetings with clients, to list a few.Where our Super Sun products were concerned, we carried a four-month stock in our warehouses. As a result, even when the dollar increased, we didn’t jack up our prices and people really appreciated this generosity. These people still remain our loyal customers.What are your social responsibility initiatives?We do social work and from last August until now we have been donating food and other materials for some schools in the Wattala and Kelaniya educational zones. The principals and staff of these schools are grateful to us for keeping the students well fed and making them keen to pursue their studies. The schools’ education standards have also gone up as a result.Tell us more about  yourself. I am a Lion and a member of the Lions Club of Maththumagala. I am the Vice President of the Sri Jayewardenepura University Alumnae Association and also the President of the University Alumnae and at the moment I am reading for my DBA (Doctor of Business Administration) at the University of Kelaniya.I also am a visiting lecturer, visiting universities and schools to promote entrepreneurship for the new generation.You have a strong sense of gratitude. What is your message to society and our readers?Gratitude is pausing to notice and appreciate the things that we often take for granted, like having a place to live, food, clean water, friends, family, gainful employment, understanding bosses, even a country we can call our motherland. It is about taking a moment to reflect on how fortunate we are when something good happens – whether it’s a small thing or a big thing.It is sad to reflect, however, that this most valuable feature of life seems almost gone and harder to retrieve. That is why we often hear about professionals, academics, and the educated clamouring to desert the ship when things go sour. We even have a definition for it – brain drain.Yet, take a moment and ponder over the case of a doctor or an engineer, whose higher education burdens are shouldered by the country’s taxpayers and who then lead carefree lives despite the misery of poor parents, in most instances. Don’t you think they owe a debt to the country? Don’t they have to pay back what they received for free from the country? What if the county became devoid of such brains? What will be the future of the generations to come? This is the hour we have to stand by our country, not leave it for an illusory pot of gold.With a good captain, a rough ocean turns into a calm lake but with a bad captain, a calm lake turns into a rough ocean. Our country needs a good captain to take the country out of the present morass.I will never leave my country. At the moment, because of me, 175 families lead happy lives. If I am able to increase it to 250 families, I will be the happiest being on earth.

However, CDPLC recommended afloat repairs at HIP, which was a much more convenient and cost-effective solution.“HIP, being the closest in the region to east-west shipping lanes, makes the port an ideal destination for ships requiring any type of repairs and we have the necessary skills, and deep draft berthing capacity to handle afloat services, which will be a value addition to the shipping industry.  We plan on aggressively promoting this service in the coming year,” stated Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG) COO Tissa Wickramasinghe. The MV Sandpiper which completed the repairs successfully, is now back in operation.  An equally complex repair was handled by CDPLC on MV Sunny Hill, while she was berthed at Hambantota International Port in March this year.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/3p8X98aYwTZLJ6QC1Ex0,07 Apr 2024 | By Dr. Lakmini Fernando and Sulochana Silva,Regional integration to empower Lankan women,"Inequality results in adverse economic, social, and political consequences. Unlike in advanced economies, improvements in education, fertility, and incomes have not been able to enhance women’s labour force participation in Sri Lanka. Gender equality is a shared vision for social justice. Thus, addressing gender inequality is crucial to achieve stronger and more sustainable development. While regional integration is seen as a potential development strategy to promote inclusive and sustainable growth and efforts toward women’s economic empowerment, gender equality tends to be sidelined in such discussions. Thus, identifying and implementing the right policy mix for meaningful regional integration is vital in creating gender inclusive sustainable growth.The impact of greater economic opportunities for womenGreater economic opportunities for women create a domino effect. In South Asia, equal employment opportunities for men and women are estimated to enhance incomes by 25%, including increased intraregional trade of $ 44 billion. Yet, despite the improvements in education and health outcomes, low women’s economic participation remains a critical development challenge for developing economies, including South Asia. In 2021, female labour force participation was 22% and 32% for South Asia and Sri Lanka, respectively, while all other regions except the Middle East and North Africa (18%) recorded more than 50% participation. Also, a gender wage gap of 24% indicates that on average, women are paid approximately 20% less than men in Sri Lanka. To achieve gender parity, South Asia will take 149 years, while this is 67 and 95 years for Europe and North America, respectively. Regional integration: Current challenges and opportunitiesUnlike South Asia, other regions like East Asia, Europe, and North America are harnessing the potential benefits of regional integration by developing strong relationships with their neighbours. Intraregional trade accounts for 50% of total trade in East Asia and 22% in Sub-Saharan Africa, but only 5% in South Asia. Intraregional trade as a share of regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is only 1% in South Asia while it is 2.6% and 11% in Sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia and the Pacific, respectively. South Asian regional integration has been restricted mainly by high tariff and non-tariff measures, lack of trust and political will, weak policy implementation, and poor infrastructure. Although the impacts are asymmetric, deeper regional integration benefits any country. Consumers gain access to cheaper goods and services; producers and exporters gain access to inputs, investment, and production networks; and firms gain market access for goods and services. Reforming stagnating dimensions of regional integration toward gender-inclusive growthTo promote gender-inclusive growth, a recent Institute of Police Studies of Sri Lanka (IPS) study shows that it is essential to improve the stagnating dimensions of regional integration. This process is complex and varies by country due to its multidimensional nature. There are six key dimensions: trade and investment, movement of capital, regional value chains, infrastructure and connectivity, people’s mobility, and legal and institutional basis for international policy cooperation. Evenly distributed dimensions lead to better regional integration and higher women’s economic participation. With the most evenly distributed dimensions, the EU is recognised as the most advanced and consistent in regional integration (Figure 1), with more than 50% women’s economic participation. In contrast, South Asia’s significantly uneven dimensional distribution makes it one of the least integrated and lowest women’s economic participating regions in the world. South Asia focuses more on infrastructure and connectivity and movement of people and less on money and finance. Similarly, Sri Lanka’s regional integration is impacted heavily by infrastructure and connectivity and this is no surprise as nearly 60% of public investment has been allocated to infrastructure development in the last few decades (Table 1). The IPS study further reveals that improvements to institutional and social integration and money and finance reduce nearly 50% of gender inequality in South Asia. Furthermore, better institutional and social integration and movement of people positively impact women in industry and services sectors but not agriculture. In developing countries, women often engage in labour-intensive sectors, which are low-skilled and low-paid, referred to as the ‘feminisation of labour’. Regional integration creates new employment opportunities in the manufacturing and services sectors. This results in technology-led ‘defeminisation of labour,’ leading to increased demand for female labour and higher wages. In contrast, trade and integration negatively impact women in agriculture due to their limited skills and mobility. Regional integration alters the structure of production where sectors with export opportunities may expand, while import substitution sectors may contract. Women in the contracting sectors may face job losses. Even in expanding sectors, women may not have benefited due to horizontal and vertical gender segregation. Thus, selective opening of sectors and providing opportunities for upskilling and reskilling of women will help minimise the negative impacts. Way forwardSri Lanka is yet to receive the full benefits of regional integration. Inherently, regional integration is multidimensional and its impacts are country-specific. In boosting gender inclusive sustainable growth, a balanced contribution of different dimensions of regional integration is required. Improvements to most stagnating dimensions like institutional and social integration and money and finance would reduce gender inequality by nearly 50%. Thus, robust domestic policies that support the establishment of quality institutions and governance systems and financial conduct are most effective in making regional integration a strategy that stimulates inclusive growth and women’s economic empowerment in Sri Lanka.This research was supported by the World Bank South Asia Gender Innovation Lab’s (SAR GIL) Women’s Economic Empowerment in South Asia Community of Practice  (Dr. Lakmini Fernando is a Research Fellow at IPS and holds a BSc in Agriculture from the University of Peradeniya, a Master of Development Economics [Advanced] from the University of Queensland, Australia, and a PhD in Economics from the University of Adelaide, Australia)(Sulochana Silva is a Research Assistant at IPS and holds a BSc (Hons) in Agricultural Technology and Management specialising in Applied Economics and Business Management from the University of Peradeniya)Figure 1: Heterogeneity in the contribution of multiple dimensions of regional integrationNotes: Regions with the most evenly distributed dimensions have the highest female labour force participation e.g.: European UnionSource: Adopted from Park, C.Y., and Claveria, R.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/bPjCWpHEndvUmfEnthNU,11 Apr 2023,Exporters less pessimistic on economic outlook,"Despite the outlook on the export orders likely to slow down during the first half of 2023, the export firms are more optimistic in their views on the economy’s outlook relative to six months ago, a survey shows.  The  survey that was conducted by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC), which covers the second half of 2022 and the outlook for the first half of 2023, revealed that the fall in export orders led to significant underutilisation of capacity within the export sector, which is expected to continue into 2023. Exporters stressed that the negative image of the country and domestic regulation were key challenges for them during the second half of 2022. Firms had to focus their attention on retaining existing clients that were looking to move to competitor countries due to the negative perception of the country. As such, the thrust of finding new buyers and venturing into new products and services was limited. Domestic regulations such as import restrictions and clearance delays at the port were cited as some of the domestic constraints. The most concerning factor however is related to labour, where higher labour attrition was recorded compared to the  past survey due to migration that could lead to a skills shortage in the medium- to long-term.SMEs who were 71% of the respondent firms stated that the foreign exchange crisis hampered their ability to export, due to the loss of suppliers or delays by suppliers. SMEs, which comprise the majority of respondent service exporters, noted a sharp fall in demand for services, which is likely to slow export growth during 2023. However, it was interesting to note that larger firms saw a greater decline in export revenue compared to SMEs.To counteract the slowdown in exports led by the global slowdown, it will be important to maintain economic and political stability, continue to provide uninterrupted power and assist firms with market access opportunities.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/tZ8nkQbDVZOjDbWLg2ZH,13 Dec 2023,Liquor production licence: Tax evaders’ licences to be suspended,"The Committee on Ways and Means of the Parliament directed the officials of Excise Department to suspend the liquor production licence of the liquor manufacturing company that has not paid the due tax instalment on 04.12.2023 according to the instalment plan to pay the arrears of excise duty.Furthermore, the committee asked why the relevant report was not provided by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) as per the order made by the committee on 24 July to provide a list of taxpayers whose taxes are Rs. 100 million or more in arrears as of 30 June. The related report was requested from the IRD in two sessions of the committee meetings, but so far it has not been received, the committee chair said. The IRD officials stated that they have sought the opinion of the Attorney General in that regard and the committee ordered the officials to provide the list to the committee before 31 December..The Committee expressed its displeasure regarding not providing reports related to some of the recommendations given in relation to the Inland Revenue Department, asking for time, and not implementing the recommendations.This was discussed when the Committee on Ways and Means met recently (6) under the chairmanship of Parliamentarian Patali Champika Ranawaka.The Government had banned the import of wheat flour for companies other than Prima and Serendib, the main wheat importing companies, and during the ban, these two companies had accumulated large stocks of flour, and the committee emphasised that these companies have made a considerable profit by imposing a tax of Rs. 16 per kg on wheat flour after the ban was lifted.Furthermore, it was also discussed that by increasing the special commodity tax for sugar from 25 cents to Rs. 50, the relevant companies have earned a considerable amount of unfair profit by releasing nearly 8500 Tons of sugar that had been imported and stored in the market. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017, the committee again directed to take immediate steps to collect the prescribed tax related to the improper profit thus earned from the relevant parties in the above 3 cases.In order to recover the arrears of the taxpayers who are evading taxes, the committee advised to prepare a tax collection plan to recover the amount of Rs. 173 billion in collectable taxes. The Chairman of the Committee recommended that the Ministry of Finance and the Inland Revenue Department should prepare this together and implement it before 31 December.Among the 39 recommendations made to the Excise Department, the committee questioned why the recommendation of the committee to increase the licence renewal fee to a minimum of Rs. 10 million has not been implemented so far. Also, the committee questioned the fact that although the committee had ordered to provide the committee with a list of individuals and companies in possession of more than one liquor licence in one district, that order had not been implemented. The officials of the Excise Department stated that according to the data system of the Department, that there are no individuals and companies in possession of more than one liquor licence in a district, and the Committee directed the Excise Department to inform the Committee in writing.Furthermore, the Excise Department stated that there are currently 46 toddy production plants and a mobile app has been introduced as per the order made by the committee to prepare a system to monitor the 46 production plants on a daily basis and to calculate their daily production. The committee chair instructed the officers to present the mobile app to the committee.Emphasising the need to add artificial intelligence (AI) to scanners in the Sri Lanka Customs technical system, the chairman of the committee advised the officials to prepare a proposal for this under a public private joint project model under the guidance of IT consultants with the Ministry of Finance.A follow-up on Disaster Management, Welfare Benefit Scheme and Social Services Department's survey involving urban beggars was also discussed in the Committee on Ways and Means.Officials from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Defence, Inland Revenue Department, Excise Department, Sri Lanka Customs, Welfare Benefits Board were summoned for this committee.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/QJbJtZX6rSas6oyh7Swa,25 Dec 2022 | By Shamindri Kadupitiyage,Finding value-centric mobile plans amid economic challenges,"Like many around the world, Sri Lankans are finding themselves spending an increasingly large amount of their time online. It’s therefore not surprising that increased usage comes with even larger bills for data and voice calls. Meanwhile, most telcos have raised their base prices, which means that the average mobile user is getting squeezed from both sides. This is hardly a fair deal, especially for prepaid customers who are already struggling with a massive increase in daily and monthly expenses as a result of the ongoing economic crisis. Many are being forced to make difficult choices. They need to pay for increasingly expensive essentials like food and electricity while also paying for data to keep working, studying, and simply to stay on top of the news to know when the next power cut or fuel shipment may happen.     The first to respond to this growing pain point was Airtel Lanka, which came out with unlimited voice and data plans. Its promise was simple: make a single payment and it will be enough to keep you supplied with anytime data and social media essentials like WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, and YouTube as well as unlimited voice calls. Following this was Hutch, with Dialog and Mobitel later launching their own versions which, on the surface at least, are making the same kind of promise. However, who is offering the best value? Let’s take a closer look at Figure 1.     If a user is able to maintain careful control over their usage, they may be able to get a slight discount when working with the larger players, whereas the two smaller players offer a slightly higher price point, but with the major benefit of unlimited social media browsing. Looking at the total value offered to customers, it is clear that Airtel’s unlimited packages offer maximum value in terms of unlimited voice, unlimited social media (YouTube, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Messenger), and additional 30 GB anytime data which can be used to access other services like TikTok, Instagram, work from home, Zoom, and MS Teams, plus browsing for the whole month. Hutch offers numerous unlimited social media apps but only offers 3 GB for additional usage. Dialog and Mobitel only offer unlimited voice as main attractions.Airtel is currently the only provider which has structured its offering with what is essentially a safety net, in the form of a daily data quota for regular browsing. While this may limit the amount consumed, the trade-off is that every user is guaranteed connectivity for the entire 30 days – something which none of the others offer. Of course, while price remains a major consideration, it is just one of multiple factors which consumers consider, together with network quality and individual usage patterns. However, in the context of an unprecedented economic crisis and both of the smaller telcos making bold value plays in terms of unlimited browsing, it remains to be seen whether the incumbents will stick with their current model which cuts off users from service entirely if they are unable to meet their bills. Ultimately, it will be the consumer who decides when they vote with their wallet.       (The writer has experience writing articles and scripts for short videos on a freelance basis and has worked with Brides of Sri Lanka magazine, Arteculate, and Pulse.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/vSVBwW79gfXH6wXOSHgT,08 Jan 2023,Preparing for global recessions,"A global recession is coming in 2023 and you should act now to protect your investments, warns deVere Group CEO Nigel Green, whose organisation is an independent financial advisory and asset management firm.“In recent weeks, the chorus of warnings about an imminent global recession has been getting ever louder,” Green said. “From the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, and the World Economic Forum, to the IMF and even Elon Musk, the consensus is growing that the world economy will fall into recession in 2023.”Signs that indicate a global recession is on its way“The strength of the dollar is one major indicator. It’s seen as a safe haven in turbulent times for investors. However, it also creates major issues for most other countries as it becomes more expensive to import. In addition, a strong dollar can be bad for Wall Street as many listed firms earn a good chunk of their profits outside the US,” Green said.“Inflation is another. As it continues to run red-hot, households and firms have less money to spend on goods and services. Financial habits are adjusted and downsized, which drags on economic growth throughout the wider economy.“Also, corporations around the world are tightening their belts and suggesting earnings will be lower as demand drops, supply chain issues remain, and borrowing gets more expensive as central banks, determined to control inflation, raise interest rates.”How to protect your portfolio during a global recession“There will be opportunities not only to protect but to grow your wealth, despite a recession,” said Green. “You’ve just got to be extra savvy.”As the risks of a global recession ramp up, there remains one clear way for investors to maximise returns relative to risk: the time-honoured practice of portfolio diversification.“A considered mix of asset classes, sectors, regions and currencies offers you protection from shocks.”“You should take a look at stocks that are likely to be recession-resistant. For example, people will still need food, energy, and financial services during a downturn. These sectors should do well. Seek out more undervalued, quality stocks – look for robust balance sheets, good future-focused outlooks, and steady profits. In addition, in an environment of rising inflation and interest rates, less familiar, return-enhancing asset classes should also be considered,” Green said.These might include venture capital, structured products, cryptocurrencies, high-dividend stocks, hedge funds, and managed futures. “Recessions are always painful and a global one is expected to come next year but they can also be times of opportunity if you stay fully and wisely invested. One silver lining about this one is that we know it’s coming, so we can prepare to protect our money ahead of time.”(The article was originally published in Business Tech)

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/MUukQgtGAsZNI4tOc6LV,07 Sep 2023 | By Lakshila Wanigasinghe,Revamping welfare: Is Aswesuma the salvation SL’s poor hoped for?,"With the introduction of Aswesuma as a brand new initiative targeting the poor and vulnerable, social protection in Sri Lanka has been a much-debated subject lately. Aswesuma primarily intends to overcome some key weaknesses of existing social protection programmes – at least on paper – but several challenges prevail. However, opinions regarding its capabilities to accomplish this remain ambiguous. The public has been protesting the scheme, and opposition party critics have called it an unfair political gimmick. Initially scheduled for disbursement in July, the benefits for the month finally commenced distribution last Monday (28 August) for 800,000 beneficiaries. This blog delves into the key areas that warrant clarification, with the hope that authorities will address these concerns transparently.Eligibility and beneficiary selectionAswesuma introduces a multi-dimensional approach to poverty assessment, a notable improvement from the family size-based method employed by its predecessor, Samurdhi. Aswesuma employs six criteria measured by 22 indicators to determine if a household is non-poor or poor and deserving of assistance. Accordingly, eligible families receive assistance under four social groups (Table 1).Table 1 – Aswesuma beneficiary classification and amountsSocial groupNumber of beneficiaries/ familiesProposed monthlywelfare allowance perfamily unit (Rs.)Transitional (until 31 December 2023)400,0002,500Vulnerable (until 31 March 2024)400,0005,000Poor (for 3 years from 1 July 2023)800,0008,500Severely poor (for 3 years from 1 July 2023)400,00015,000Source: Gazette No. 2328/13 (21 April 2023)Publication of Aswesuma’s initial eligibility lists sparked concerns as many households called it unfair and demanded re-evaluations. As a result, 982,770 appeals and 62,368 objections arose from the process that followed. The sizeable appeals and objections raise questions about the accuracy of the selection process. Nearly 650,000 appeals were from already approved beneficiaries requesting an upgrade to a higher allowance category.  However, without information on the cut-off points for the total number of families per beneficiary category and criteria determining allowance amounts, it is difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the methodologies’ ability to identify the most deserving families. The appropriateness of certain indicators, such as those assessing the ""economic level”, comes under scrutiny due to their sensitivity to fluctuations like electricity consumption patterns and inconsistent monthly incomes.Fate of Samurdhi recipients In 2022, Samurdhi cash transfers supported approximately 1.76 million beneficiaries. In contrast, Aswesuma aims to support 2 million beneficiaries annually. So far, Aswesuma has over 1.7 million eligible beneficiaries, of which nearly 950,000 are families that did not previously receive government welfare assistance. Over 1.28 million Samurdhi recipient households applied for Aswesuma, of which only 887,653 are eligible. Cabinet approval was recently granted to extend Samurdhi cash transfers to 393,094 existing Samurdhi recipients unqualified for Aswesuma until the appeals and objections process concludes. Perhaps some of them will be included in Aswesuma’s final beneficiary list; however, it is unlikely that all will. Since Aswesuma attempts to correct Samurdhi’s targeting errors, understandably, some existing Samurdhi recipients are left out. However, it is important to ensure that those truly in need are included. Failure to do so will remove the support these families receive through Samurdhi and leave them without Aswesuma. Additionally, uncertainties linger for recipients who did not apply for Aswesuma (households that were unaware of the application process, missed the deadline, etc.), leaving them without any support.Monitoring and evaluationAswesuma will conduct annual beneficiary evaluations to ensure support to the most deserving. While eliminating non-deserving beneficiaries (one of Samurdhi’s key weaknesses) is much needed, concerns exist as it is unclear how reassessments will occur. Conducting household surveys annually is tedious, especially considering that beneficiaries are expected to be selected for Aswesuma’s second year even before the official commencement of the first. The transitional and vulnerable beneficiary categories only receive assistance for a short period. Given this, will new beneficiaries be added to these categories after the end of the allowance period or following yearly revaluations? Samurdhi bank regulationAswesuma benefits will be dispensed as direct deposits to beneficiary bank accounts. This is only to involve banks regulated under the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). This approach aims to prevent third-party involvement in the process, as seen with Samurdhi, where cash transfers were done via the Samurdhi Department. Interest has been shown to regulate Samurdhi banks and bring them under the purview of the CBSL. In this regard, discussions are underway on developing a credible system to regulate the Samurdhi banking system. Samurdhi banks established under the Samurdhi Authority Act operate as independent bodies. Hence, regulating them would likely require amendments to the Act, which is a complex and time-consuming task. After regulation, using Samurdhi banks for the Aswesuma benefit disbursement seems like the obvious choice. Samurdhi is a familiar entity among villagers, and its widespread banking network makes it easily accessible rurally. However, the regulation has not yet been confirmed, and if it were to occur, it cannot be done within a short span of time, and hence, its ability to support Aswesuma in its initial three years is unlikely.  Continuity of AswesumaAttempting to correct the weaknesses of existing poverty alleviation programmes is a good starting point. However, this must be done in a logical manner. On paper, Aswesuma seems somewhat convincing, yet its practical application is to be seen.With a three-year timeline, Aswesuma’s true impact on poverty alleviation remains uncertain. Whether the programme will be extended or if Aswesuma will conclude as a short-term relief initiative and be replaced with a new long-term poverty-targeted programme remains undisclosed. Nonetheless, the success or failure of Aswesuma depends not on its ability to provide temporary relief but on whether it helps families graduate from poverty. Ultimately, the focus of any poverty-targeted programme should be to strive towards poverty alleviation. Although this is a long-term goal, benefits received through Aswesuma should at least push recipients toward improving their lives and livelihoods. Aswesuma should have a mechanism to support families in discontinuing their reliance on government assistance. Irrespective of whether this is done through Aswesuma or Samurdhi, it is important to communicate these plans with all relevant parties clearly.Aswesuma’s continuity involves better information dissemination to avoid confusion among recipients, policymakers, and implementers. Flexibility will be key as this is undoubtedly a learning experience with corrective measures to be taken along the way. As the scheme encountered several practical challenges during implementation, addressing them and providing the first instalment to the most deserving families is of utmost importance now. (Lakshila Wanigasinghe is a Research Officer at the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka [IPS] currently working in the area of poverty and social welfare research.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/Mvt5AwMXJVo3G0kspLj5,18 Apr 2024,Prices turns sideways as interest rates return to higher/longer stance,"Gold price (XAU/USD) balances below $ 2,400 in Wednesday (17)’s European session. The precious metal struggles to recapture new all-time highs around $ 2,430 as Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell emphasised maintaining the restrictive policy framework for a longer period. Powell and his colleagues seem to be leaning towards keeping interest rates higher for longer as inflation has remained stubborn and the labour demand remained strong.The prospects for the Fed keeping interest rates higher for longer bodes well for the US Dollar (USD) and US bond yields. 10-year US Treasury yields fell slightly but remained close to a five-month high around 4.70%. The US Dollar Index (DXY) which measures the Greenback’s value against six major currencies, turns sideways after refreshing a five-month high near 106.40.Meanwhile, deepening Middle East tensions hold strong ground for Gold. Israel prepares to respond to Iran’s attack. However, US President Joe Biden said it will not support the counterattack from Israel. The US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Tuesday that the US administration intends to levy new sanctions on Iran after it attacks Israel. Fresh sanctions on Iran could impact their capacity to export Oil.Gold price trades below the crucial resistance of $ 2,400. The precious metal consolidates as a hawkish interest rate outlook from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has limited the upside while escalating Middle East tensions continue to offer firm ground.On Tuesday (16), Jerome Powell supported keeping interest rates higher for a longer period as current inflation data is not giving confidence that price pressures will return to the desired rate of 2%. “The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it’s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,” Powell said, according to Reuters.Powell added that strong labour demand and slowing disinflation progress in the first three months of this year suggest that the restrictive monetary policy framework should be given more time to work to bring inflation down to 2%.The Fed’s confidence in progress in inflation easing to the required rate of 2% was questioned after the March Consumer Price Index (CPI) data surprisingly rose more than estimated. Also, robust Retail Sales data for March have reinforced expectations that the inflation outlook will remain stubborn.On the geopolitical front, escalating Middle East tensions keep the safe-haven bid firm. Fears of Middle East tensions spreading beyond Gaza have escalated as Israel prepares to retaliate for the airstrike by Iran on their territory on Saturday. Iran aimed hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel in response to their attack on the Iranian embassy near Damascus in Syria in which two high-ranked generals were killed. The appeal for Gold as a safe-haven asset strengthens when investors see geopolitical tensions worsening further.Meanwhile, Fed policymakers are lined up to provide fresh guidance on interest rates this week. Policymakers are expected to maintain the argument that interest rates need to remain higher for long enough until they get evidence that inflation will sustainably return to the desired rate of 2%.Gold price trades sideways inside Tuesday’s trading range around $ 2,380. The upside in the precious metal remains limited as momentum oscillators are cooling down after turning extremely overbought. The 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart drops slightly after peaking around 85.00. However, the broader-term demand is intact as the RSI remains in the bullish range of 60.00-80.00. On the downside, April 5 low near $ 2,268 and March 21 high at $ 2,223 will be major support areas.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/f4L68rcY34exGr3td7iZ,27 Mar 2024,CBSL further reduces policy rates,"The Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided to reduce the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 50 basis points (bps) to 8.50% and 9.50%, respectively. The Board said it arrived at this decision at its meeting held on Monday (25) following a comprehensive assessment of current and expected domestic and international economic developments, to maintain inflation at the targeted level of 5 percent over the medium-term while enabling the economy to reach its potential.“In arriving at this decision, the Board took note of, among others, subdued aggregate demand conditions, the lesser-than-expected impact of the recent changes to the tax structure on inflation, favourable near-term inflation dynamics due to the recent adjustment to electricity tariffs, well-anchored inflation expectations, the absence of excessive external sector pressures and the need to continue the downward trajectory in market interest rates.” The Board observed that the possible upside risks to inflation in the near term would not materially change the medium-term inflation outlook, as economic activity is projected to remain below par for an extended period, the statement said. The Monetary Policy Board underscored the need for a swift and full passthrough of monetary easing measures to market interest rates, particularly lending rates, by the financial institutions, thereby accelerating the normalisation of market interest rates in the period ahead.The Board also noted the improvements in domestic money market activity alongside the improvement in liquidity conditions and decided to remove the remaining restrictions on the usage of the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) of the Central Bank with effect from 1 April 2024. “This would further support market-based transmission of monetary policy adjustments,” it said. “The Monetary Policy Board stressed the need for all financial institutions to take swift measures to reduce market lending interest rates to ensure that the benefits of the series of monetary policy easing measures are adequately passed on to businesses and households.”

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/DCm2apI0o72B5BNaCW3z,23 Apr 2023 | By Tanya Shan,Unwinding in paradise,"Elevating the wellness tourism scene in Sri LankaWith its rich history and diverse culture, Sri Lanka has long been a popular tourist destination. The country is known for its stunning beaches, scenic landscapes, and vibrant cities. However, in recent years, there has been a growing interest in wellness tourism in Sri Lanka. This type of tourism involves travelling for the purpose of improving one’s physical, mental, or spiritual health. Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Chairman Priantha Fernando stated that the authorities were promoting wellness tourism by encouraging more wellness tour operators to come in. “Additionally, we are looking into training therapists under an EU-funded programme, because demand is expected to increase. Currently, Sri Lanka lacks the expertise and skill in the wellness industry, so we are trying to increase the number of skilled individuals in the industry and to create more opportunities for locals to join,” Fernando stated. According to him, in order to encourage wellness operators to come to Sri Lanka, the authorities are giving prominence to and creating a foreign investment path by speaking to investors. “If we can get some renowned brands to enter, it will give good coverage. We are taking up Hela Wedakama and Ayurveda under the wellness sector and currently there is an Indian group here that is looking at spiritual tourism, yoga, and martial arts. We are looking at the correct destination to promote these areas,” he explained. Strategies to be employedTo improve wellness tourism in Sri Lanka, there are several key strategies that can be employed. Firstly, there is a need to develop and promote the country’s wellness tourism infrastructure. This includes investing in new wellness facilities, such as spas and wellness retreats, as well as improving existing facilities. The Government can offer incentives to private investors to encourage the development of these facilities and work with the tourism board to promote them to potential visitors.Secondly, awareness should be raised about Sri Lanka’s wellness tourism offerings. This can be achieved through targeted marketing campaigns, both domestically and internationally, highlighting the benefits of wellness travel and the country’s unique offerings. Social media and other digital marketing channels can also be used to reach potential visitors and showcase the country’s wellness tourism attractions.Thirdly, it should be ensured that wellness tourism in Sri Lanka is sustainable and responsible. This can involve implementing eco-friendly practices in wellness facilities, promoting cultural sensitivity, and ensuring that local communities benefit from the growth of wellness tourism. The Government can work with private sector partners to develop sustainability guidelines for wellness tourism operators and establish a certification system to ensure compliance.Finally, partnerships and collaborations need to be built between different stakeholders in the wellness tourism industry. This can involve working with travel agents, tour operators, and airlines to create wellness travel packages that offer a seamless and hassle-free experience for visitors. Additionally, partnerships can be formed with local communities to create authentic and culturally-immersive wellness experiences.More to be doneMeanwhile, both The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) President M. Shanthikumar and Andrew the Travel Company Founder/Chairman Mahen Kariyawasam shared similar views with The Sunday Morning Business. Shanthikumar stated that the industry had been trying to promote wellness tourism for quite some time and that it was working on it, adding that Europeans were generally very excited about and keen on this aspect of tourism.  Meanwhile, Kariyawasam stated that even though wellness tourism was being promoted at the moment, there was still room to expand. Wellness tourism has great potential to contribute to the growth of Sri Lanka’s tourism industry. By investing in infrastructure, promoting awareness, ensuring sustainability, and building partnerships, the country can position itself as a leading wellness tourism destination. Not only would this bring economic benefits, but it will also contribute to the health and wellbeing of visitors and local communities alike.Cosmetic tourismCosmetic tourism too is gaining popularity across the world and Sri Lanka is no exception. The country has been gradually expanding its medical tourism sector and cosmetic surgery has emerged as a significant component in this. Cosmetic tourism in Sri Lanka involves a combination of medical expertise and picturesque scenery, which attracts visitors from all over the world.Cosmetic surgery has become increasingly popular over the years and Sri Lanka has been offering various types of cosmetic surgeries to its clients. From facelifts to breast augmentation, tummy tucks to liposuction, the country’s cosmetic surgery industry has been growing by leaps and bounds.A cosmetic surgeon, on the condition of anonymity, told The Sunday Morning Business that this growth was because Sri Lanka had a vast pool of talented and experienced plastic surgeons who had been trained in some of the best institutions in the world. She added that these surgeons had been using state-of-the-art technologies to perform complex cosmetic surgeries with ease.“One of the primary reasons why cosmetic tourism in Sri Lanka has been growing is because the costs of cosmetic surgeries are significantly lower than in Western countries. A procedure that could cost tens of thousands of dollars in the US can be done for a fraction of that price in Sri Lanka. This has made cosmetic surgery affordable for many people who could not afford it otherwise,” she added. According to her, another reason why cosmetic tourism in Sri Lanka has been growing is the picturesque scenery that the country has to offer. “Patients who come to Sri Lanka for cosmetic surgery have the opportunity to combine their medical treatment with a relaxing holiday. Sri Lanka is famous for its stunning beaches, lush green forests, and serene landscapes, making it an ideal destination for tourists who want to unwind and enjoy a peaceful environment.”However, she added that despite the growth of the cosmetic tourism industry in Sri Lanka, there were challenges that the country must address. One of the biggest challenges is the need to create awareness about the industry. Many are still unaware of the benefits of cosmetic tourism and there is a need to promote the industry more aggressively. Additionally, it should be ensured that quality standards are maintained to provide a safe and reliable service to clients.Cosmetic tourism in Sri Lanka has been growing steadily and the country has a lot to offer to its clients. With its talented plastic surgeons, state-of-the-art technologies, picturesque scenery, and affordable costs, Sri Lanka has the potential to become a leading destination for cosmetic tourism. The Government, medical professionals, and the tourism industry need to work together to promote the industry and ensure that quality standards are maintained to attract more clients to Sri Lanka for cosmetic surgery.However, SLTDA Chair Fernando was of the view that cosmetic tourism was yet to take off in a significant way in Sri Lanka, while admitting that there was a demand for health tourism. “Currently, only two hospitals are specialised in the field. We need to do proper research and study cosmetic tourism. If we look at Thailand and India, a lot of people are going for health tourism. We have the infrastructure and it’s just a matter of packaging and marketing. Private sector involvement will be required,” Fernando stated.

We have to get that before we go anywhere else. Since the EU does not have this requirement, they are willing to get us on board for tea. However, it will be limited to the EU,” he said.De Mel expressed hope that Sri Lanka would be able to secure the GI for Ceylon Tea within this year.The SLTB signed a tripartite agreement with the AFD and CIRAD in 2021, where the AFD agreed to provide a € 1 million grant as technical assistance to the SLTB through CIRAD for the development of the GI for Ceylon Tea.GI certification serves to uphold and authenticate the quality, reputation, and characteristics of a product by linking it to a specific territory through intellectual property protection, while also giving it added value in national and international markets. Therefore, the creation of a GI for Ceylon Tea is aimed at promoting quality products, protecting the traditional know-how it is based upon, and enhancing its commercial value and recognition in international markets.

A dozen of these accounts are meant for trade with Moscow.Russian banks like Sberbank, VTB, Gazprom, MTS, and Tinkoff have opened such accounts with either Indian banks or their own branches in India, said the sources, adding that banks from Mauritius and Sri Lanka have opened vostro accounts with the State Bank of India.Sri Lankan banks have also opened such accounts with Indian banks and with a branch of Bank of Ceylon in India, they added.To be sure, no specific Indian bank has been authorised by the Indian Government to facilitate rupee trade with any particular country and all interested banks are allowed to open such accounts with any country of their choice, said one of the sources.Given that about 30-35 countries, including those from Asia, Scandinavia, and Africa, have expressed interest in better understanding the proposed rupee trade mechanism for possible adoption, the number of vostro accounts is expected to rise in the near future.As reported by Financial Express, the Indian Finance Ministry has asked the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) and the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) to spearhead an awareness campaign to sensitise stakeholders about the rupee trade. The IBA will be guided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in this exercise.The countries that are keen on rupee trade also include neighbours such as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Myanmar and Mauritius. These countries have been grappling with a shortage of dollar reserves.The RBI had, in July, notified the new mechanism for settling international trade in the rupee. This was aimed at not just reducing the rupee against the dollar but also internationalising the domestic currency.Subsequently, the commerce ministry notified guidelines that will enable exporters to get stipulated benefits under the foreign trade policy even if the export realisation is in the domestic currency and not the dollar.According to the notification of the directorate general of foreign trade, domestic firms undertaking imports through this mechanism will make payment in the rupee, which will be credited into the special vostro account of the correspondent bank of the partner country, against the invoices for the supply of goods or services from the overseas seller/supplier.Similarly, Indian firms undertaking exports of goods and services through this mechanism will be paid the export proceeds in the rupee from the balances in the designated vostro account of the correspondent bank of the trade partner.(The Financial Express)

India’s Adani group signed up for two wind power plants worth $442 million last year.In the first quarter, Sri Lanka has received proposals worth $600 million, said BOI Director General Renuka Weerakone, with 22 new projects and six expansions.“The acid test is really in what comes in, that is what really helps the economy,” she told Reuters.Sri Lanka is banking on information technology, solar and wind, bunkering and mineral processing to attract investments.India’s MCS Group has signed a $20 million deal for mineral processing, the largest the country has received so far in 2023, Weerakone said.Other countries are also keen.“Japan is very interested in minerals, so is China,” she said. “The raw material we have is something we can really pitch to get new investments.”Sri Lanka has untapped deposits of graphite, phosphate and other minerals to attract investors but policy frameworks are yet to be updated, creating a bottleneck for FDI, Weerakone added.Over the last decade, China has invested about $3 billion in Sri Lanka, accounting for nearly a quarter of its FDI, while India made up about $1.3 billion. In the last two years, India took the lead, followed by the United Kingdom in 2022 and the Netherlands in 2021.Sri Lanka is also drawing up plans to identify new islands for investors to help resuscitate its $4 billion tourism industry.(Reuters)

Today, our industry faces significant challenges as orders from traditional markets continue to decline. We believe that market and product diversification is the best way to overcome these challenges, and we call on all stakeholders to extend their support to this vital mission,” Janadheera said.  With over 20 years of experience in the rubber industry, Janadheera's journey with Dipped Products PLC began in 2017 when he assumed the position of Director of Operations. His leadership and strategic insights earned him the role of Deputy Managing Director in 2020. He continued to rise within the company, ultimately being appointed Managing Director on January 1, 2023, in addition to being appointed as a member of the Hayleys Group Management Committee. Prior to joining DPL, he served as Director/General Manager at Richard Pieris Tyre Co. Ltd and Director of Manufacturing at Associated Motorways. Backed by his extensive experience and proven leadership abilities, Janadheera aims to use his tenure as SLAMERP Chairman to champion the cause of Sri Lanka’s value-added rubber industry, and engage stakeholders and Government on key policy reforms and efforts to expand market access for the industry.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/tFrexWeHGfVeyfVemfTr,15 Jan 2023,Doing nothing for investments,"Sri Lanka’s heavy reliance on imports to fulfil the basic needs of its citizens is forcing the country to look for foreign exchange earnings, as there is only one other option remaining, which is producing the required goods locally. While it is imperative to increase local production and reduce the reliance on imports even for food requirements, a nation cannot completely do away with imports, since i) that is not how global free trade operates and ii) there are economic theories explaining opportunity cost and comparative advantage ruling out the possibilities of producing each and every good a nation’s citizens need. One way the country expects foreign exchange earnings without having to lift a finger is through Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs). It is quite evident that the current economic climate of the country is by no means appealing to investors to compel them to direct their money here. It should not be forgotten that the investment climate before the economic crisis was not enticing either, thanks to bottlenecks such as lethargic and cumbersome bureaucratic processes. A couple of months ago, it was revealed by the Board of Investment (BOI) that 73 FDI projects had been languishing at different line agencies for years, particularly at the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). Seventy-three projects mean 73 interested parties, yet we are delaying these projects as if investors need Sri Lanka more than Sri Lanka needs foreign exchange earnings. The real question is, what is the BOI doing? What has it been doing all these years if such a large number of projects failed to receive approval from line agencies? What happened to the so-called National Single Window plan that is yet to be fully implemented? It is regrettable that taxpayers have to continue to pay the salaries of State workers just to have them purposefully delay or fail to give approval for FDI projects that could bring money into Sri Lanka, improve the livelihoods of Sri Lankans, and create more jobs. Instead, we have been successfully conducting promotional campaigns and discussions with envoys and businessmen to invest in Sri Lanka while the aforementioned project files languish on dusty shelves of State-Owned Enterprises. Without developing the necessary infrastructure and expediting the approval process, these State agencies are not qualified to discuss the lack of investment in the country. Who would wish to invest in a country where project approval itself takes years or where there is no update on the approval process at all? How could we even talk about investment at this stage without feeling even a smidgen of guilt over the fact that the country has missed out on many potential opportunities, which, had they been facilitated, may have prevented a debt default in the first place? Yet, after all this, the agencies and relevant officials continue to ‘work’ in shiny offices with ergonometric chairs, talking about improving investments while hoodwinking the public for decades without actually working towards expediting approval processes.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/KAfbJyw2IikzFTvQQQCS,03 Sep 2023 | – By Shenal Fernando,Iran brews new hope for Sri Lanka’s tea exports,"Tea-for-oil barter mechanism increases Ceylon Tea exportsCPC to transfer $ 5 m per month to Tea Board Tea exporters have reported a noticeable uptick in tea exports to Iran over the last month, coinciding with the initiation of the tea-for-oil barter mechanism after the transfer of the first payment tranche of $ 5 million from the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB), as stipulated in the agreement between Sri Lanka and Iran in December 2021.Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, Imperial Teas Group Founder, Chairman, and Managing Director and National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) Chairman Jayantha Karunaratne revealed that an uptick in tea exports to Iran had been observed over the past month following the introduction of the tea-for-oil barter in August.He explained that in terms of the agreement reached between Sri Lanka and Iran, the tea-for-oil barter mechanism would involve “the settlement of export proceeds in Sri Lankan Rupees by the SLTB. The CPC will transfer $ 5 million per month to the SLTB in Sri Lankan Rupees and the SLTB will pay tea exporters for exports of tea to Iran up to a value of $ 5 million.”Congruently, Iranian tea importers will pay the National Iranian Oil Company in riyals.However, Karunaratne revealed that the export of tea to Iran under this barter mechanism was limited to $ 5 million per month and that tea exports beyond that value needed to be imported under alternate arrangements entered into between Sri Lankan tea exporters and Iranian importers.Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, Sri Lanka Tea Board Chairman Niraj de Mel clarified that the agreement had been signed in December 2021 and that thereafter the enforcement of the mechanism had commenced from August 2023 onwards, following the release of the first tranche of $ 5 million by the CPC.He explained that prior to the commencement of the barter mechanism, tea exports to Iran had fallen significantly: “In previous years, we used to export around 30 million kg of tea to Iran per annum; this has now halved.”He added: “While I believe that certain tea exporters have already used this barter mechanism, I haven’t received any confirmation that any exporters have executed shipments under the mechanism. The SLTB will release payments to tea exporters only after confirmation is provided from Iran to the CPC that Iranian importers have paid the Iranian authorities. Once we receive confirmation, we will pay the respective shippers.”The SLTB Chairman stated that the agreement would last for 48 months, under which the CPC would pay the SLTB $ 5 million in Sri Lankan Rupees per month “until around $ 240 million of the $ 251 million owed by the CPC to Iran is paid off”.The introduction of this barter mechanism represents a significant development for Sri Lanka amidst its current foreign exchange liquidity and in light of Iran’s importance as a tea export market for Sri Lanka.Iranian tea exports amounted to as much as $ 125 million per annum in previous years before falling to around $ 70 million in 2022.The internal demand for tea in Iran amounts to 100,000 MT annually. Iranian tea producers yield approximately 25,000-30,000 MT per year, necessitating the import of 60,000-70,000 MT of tea from different sources.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Plantation Industries, issuing a statement, assured all parties that the barter agreement would not violate UN or US sanctions since tea was categorised as a food item on humanitarian grounds and that none of the blacklisted Iranian banks would be involved in the equation.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/qZPLFeSfbJPfmq1OPfTn,13 Apr 2024 | – By Shenal Fernando,Sharp rise in rupee expected in H2,"SLR to USD exchange rate to surge in coming monthsExpected to settle at Rs. 310-320 by year-endContrary to forecasts being made in certain political circles, market sources believe that the Sri Lankan Rupee to US Dollar exchange rate has bottomed out and will witness a sharp uptick in the second half of the year before settling at around the Rs. 310-320 level.Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, First Capital Holdings Chief Research and Strategy Officer Dimantha Mathew stated that the appreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee observed over the past few weeks had surpassed their initial targets for the exchange rate, which stood at around Rs. 310-320. However, he opined that the exchange rate had bottomed out and that it would start moving upward during the second half of the year.Elaborating further, he said that given the pent-up demand flowing into the system following the recovery of the economy in the second half of the year and the resumption of external debt payment, a sharp rise would be observed in the exchange rate before it stabilised at around Rs. 310-320 by the end of the year. Commenting on the future movement of the exchange rate, Mathew stated: “Initially, we had a bottom target of Rs. 310, which has been achieved. We believe that the exchange rate has bottomed out. We also believe that the economy will start to recover and that demand will flow into the system. “The exchange rate will start to readjust and stabilise during the second quarter. During the third and fourth quarters, we may see some improvement in the economy, which will gradually push the exchange rate upwards.” He stated that the recent appreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee was largely due to the customarily high inflow of worker remittances during April, together with the current lack of demand for imports as a consequence of preemptive measures taken by importers to import their required stocks for 2024 during the period from October to December 2023 in order to avoid the new taxes that came into effect in January.According to the average buying and selling Telegraphic Transfer (TT) exchange rates published by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as of 8 April, based on quotes provided at 9.30 a.m. by selected licensed banks, the selling rate of a US Dollar was at Rs. 303.89 and the buying rate was at Rs. 294.34.Speaking recently, President Ranil Wickremesinghe claimed that the Government was expecting the Sri Lankan Rupee to reach the Rs. 280 level by June, leading to a decrease in the prices of goods.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/Tauyyx6DMw9FjAwdrj4D,13 Mar 2024,Gold continues to rise,"The gold (XAU) price rose by 0.28% on Monday (11) despite a minor increase in the US Dollar Index (DXY).XAU/USD has been rising for nine consecutive trading sessions as the sentiment in precious metals and Bitcoin remains bullish due to general macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty.Also, the expectation that major central banks will start easing monetary policy in 2024 adds support to the assets. According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, large speculators—such as hedge funds—raised their net long positions in COMEX gold by 63,018 contracts, reaching 131,060 in the week ended 5 March. Now, they maintain their largest net-long exposure in gold since 2 January.Indeed, the market has been too eager to assume that inflation has been defeated and the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in June. Therefore, if the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report is better than expected, XAU/USD may drop sharply. Conversely, if the data aligns with the forecast or is slightly lower, XAU/USD may continue to rise slowly. 'Spot gold may retest support at $ 2,175 per ounce, a break below which could open the way towards $ 2,152–2,164 range,' said Reuters analyst Wang Tao.The euro (EUR) lost 0.1% on Monday as traders' repositioning ahead of the US inflation report pushed the US dollar slightly higher.After failing to reach the pivotal 1.10000 level on Friday, EUR/USD has been in a downtrend. Fundamentally, the pressure on the pair is bearish because the market expects more rate cuts from the European Central Bank (ECB) in 2024 than from the Federal Reserve (Fed). However, the difference is insignificant, so it's unlikely that a sustainable downward trend in EUR/USD will last long. Right now, the market awaits any fresh data that could clarify how soon the ECB and the Fed could commence their rate easing cycles this year.The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will be published today at 12:30 p.m. UTC and can certainly clarify the future path of US interest rates. The market expects the core CPI figures to rise by 0.3% month-on-month in February. “Were we to get a 0.2%, I think the market will be back on the scent of a possible May first Fed rate cut, and if we were to get a 0.4%, I think the market will be casting some doubt on a cut as early as June. So in that sense, I think it's right to think that there will be a high degree of market sensitivity to anything other than a 0.3% core print,' said National Australia Bank head of FX strategy Ray Attrill. Last month, the US CPI numbers were higher than expected, resulting in a swift 0.6% decline in EUR/USD. If today's CPI figures are higher than expected, the bearish impact on the euro may be quite strong because the market has put too much faith in a soft inflation reading. If the CPI reading is lower than expected, the impact on EUR/USD could be relatively muted. Key levels to watch are 1.09800–1.10000 and 1.091000–1.09000.The Australian dollar (AUD) lost 0.2% on Monday but held above the critical 0.65900 level, remaining within a bullish trend.AUD/USD rose last week after the Australian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures came out higher than expected, while the US statistics revealed weakness in the labour market. Fundamentally, the pressure on AUD/USD remains bullish as the market expects fewer rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) in 2024 than from the Federal Reserve (Fed).Although the divergence in interest rate paths plays a major role in exchange rate movements, the Australian dollar—a highly risk-sensitive currency—is also driven by regional trade flows and commodity prices. AUD/USD may face bearish pressure due to decreasing demand for commodities as China struggles to revive its economy. Furthermore, there is a risk that the market is too optimistic when it comes to rate cuts by the Fed. If the US inflation doesn't slow as expected, AUD/USD may drop.AUD/USD was essentially unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. If the inflation figures are higher than expected, AUD/USD will almost certainly drop, possibly below 0.65600. However, the bullish trend in AUD/USD will likely continue if the CPI figures are lower than expected. In this case, AUD/USD may attempt to break above 0.66600. (Investing)

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/OW5LbIdb2QR4ckjkT8HA,17 May 2023,ComBank Group’s deposits pass Rs. 2 tn threshold in Q1,"The Commercial Bank of Ceylon Group’s deposit base has surpassed Rs. 2 trillion, a milestone it achieved in the first quarter of 2023 despite the continuing impacts of mercurial exchange rates and market interest rates, and the effects of the economic downturn on multiple sectors of business.Commenting on these results, Commercial Bank Chairman Prof. Ananda Jayawardane said: “As can be expected, our performance reflects the challenges that stem from volatility in interest and exchange rates and a weakening economy that necessitates higher provisioning for impairment and other losses. While the solid topline growth we have recorded affirms the continuing momentum of our core banking franchise, a prudent and far-sighted approach to managing the diverse factors that impact on performance makes a decline in profit inevitable.”The Group, comprising of Sri Lanka’s biggest private sector bank, its subsidiaries and an associate, has reported noteworthy operational gains for the three months ending 31 March 2023, with gross income up 54.20% to Rs. 84.149 billion, interest income growing by 100.65% to Rs. 75.939 billion and fee and commission income improving by 35.37% to Rs. 7.301 billion compared with the first quarter of 2022.Interest income growth of the Group was driven by the sharp rise in market interest rates, which generated an 84.75% improvement in income from loans and a 127.98% increase in income from government securities in the review period. However, the same factor resulted in interest expenses for the three months ballooning by Rs. 37.940 billion or 199.43% to Rs 56.964 billion, with interest expenses on deposits of the Group increasing by 258%.Consequently, the Group’s net interest income of Rs 18.975 billion for the quarter reflected a marginal growth of 0.81%.A revaluation of the Group’s assets in foreign currency in the context of the appreciation of the rupee in the review period resulted in total assets of the Group reducing by a marginal 0.29% to Rs. 2.492 trillion as at 31 March 2023. Gross loans and advances of the Group also reduced by 4.73% over the three months to Rs. 1.187 trillion, partly due to the appreciation of the rupee. Total deposits of the Group grew by 2.31% crossing the Rs. 2 trillion threshold for the first time to reach Rs. 2.023 trillion as at 31 March 2023, mainly due to an increase in rupee-denominated deposits, and despite the value of deposits denominated in foreign currency reducing due to the appreciation of the rupee.Total operating income of the Group declined by 26.16% to Rs. 25.287 billion while the Group made a provision of Rs. 6.797 billion for impairment charges and other losses for the three months, an increase of 14.04% over the figure for the first quarter 2022. This resulted in net operating income for the period reducing by 34.63% to Rs. 18.490 billion. The operating expenses increased by 22.44% to Rs. 10.678 billion, with personnel expenses, depreciation and amortisation and other operating expenses rising by 21.69%, 30.06% and 21.61% respectively. The Group reported an operating profit before taxes on financial services of Rs. 7.812 billion for the three months, a decline of 60.07%. Taxes on financial services reduced by 66.03% to Rs. 1.072 billion, resulting in profit before income tax for the period declining by 58.91% to Rs. 6.741 billion. However, the income tax expense for the period reduced only by 48.56% as a result of an increase in the income tax rate to 30% from 24% for the Group’s Sri Lankan operations. Consequently, the Group’s net profit of Rs. 4.359 billion represented a decline of 62.98% over the net profit reported for the first quarter of 2022.Taken separately, Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC reported a profit before tax of Rs 6.337 billion for the quarter, a drop of 60.61% while profit after tax for the period was down by 64.57% to Rs. 4.091 billion.Sri Lanka’s first 100% carbon neutral bank, the first Sri Lankan bank to be listed among the Top 1000 Banks of the World and the only Sri Lankan bank to be listed for 12 years consecutively, Commercial Bank operates a network of 270 branches and 950 automated machines in Sri Lanka.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/Wz2gelT8FYQGXS9BEaZR,29 Jan 2023 | By Shenal Fernando,How can businesses survive in a volatile environment?,"Restaurateur suggests cutting costs, running at a bare minimumOperating cost reductions, low profit margins, and cash sales is the mantra of most businesses amidst the current economic downturn in the country. The question, however, is whether this will be sufficient and how many will survive. Sri Lanka’s economic conditions have nosedived since early 2022, with the depreciation of the rupee resulting in high inflation and the Government’s decision to announce a moratorium on all foreign debt on 12 April 2022. While the latest unemployment statistics released by the Department of Census and Statistics for Q2 2022 claim that unemployment is at around 4.6%, it is speculated that unemployment numbers have increased exponentially over the final two quarters of 2022. Amidst these dire conditions, the future of entrepreneurs in the island remains at risk. Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, such entrepreneurs were unified in their view that the exigent challenge for all businesses in the short term was survival. To achieve this, they claimed that they had wholeheartedly embraced operating cost reductions, low profit margins, and had moved away from credit sales to cash sales. However, the fear remains that their survival may be out of their hands, with it ultimately coming down to blind luck.Cutting operating costs Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, Harpo’s Cafes and Restaurants Chief Executive Officer (CEO)/Founder Harpo Gooneratne stated they had prioritised the reduction of operating costs while ensuring that the quality remained constant.He explained: “We are working to keep our costs down when it comes to procurement by streamlining our inventory and running at a bare minimum. Those are ways we are keeping our costs down. We have also stopped procurements on credit and lots of suppliers now ask for cash on delivery. But I think it’s a good thing because even if the worst happens and there is another lockdown, then you are not in debt to anyone. We must adapt.”Reducing inventory Similar sentiments were expressed to The Sunday Morning Business by Jeewantha Tyre House Owner Tharindu Jeewantha, who stated that demand for new tyres had fallen significantly over the past 12 months and consequently he had adapted to the present situation by reducing his inventory.“Prior to this crisis, I would sell a minimum of around 15 tyres per day. Now I sell around five tyres on a good day, so there is no point in having a large inventory. Most people are now looking to buy second hand tyres. Most lorries are no longer looking for new tyres, they prefer using dag (precure) tyres. A new tyre will cost them about Rs. 55,000; in comparison, a new casing will cost them only around Rs. 15,000 to get it dagged (precured). It’s the same for buses – their tyres used to be around Rs. 40,000 now it’s over Rs. 100,000. You can’t blame them. How can they survive at these prices?”He stated that considering the economic difficulties of consumers and the inherent competitiveness of the local tyre industry, it was essential that he adapted and reduced his profit margins. For example, in the case of tyre puncture repairs, the cost of materials had increased by 100-200%. However, he had only increased prices by around 50% because customers would otherwise baulk at a corresponding price hike in the services offered and his competitors would undercut him if he had imposed a larger price hike, he explained. Jeewantha further noted that amidst the prevailing uncertainty of demand, he had turned his attention towards offering his services to corporate clients such as logistics companies. He explained that while such an arrangement would invariably involve lower profit margins, the stability of the steady business guaranteed by such an arrangement made it worthwhile. Shifting away from credit salesSimilar sentiments were expressed by Healthy Lanka Products Owner Isuru Wanigasundara, who lamented the recent economic downturn and stated that as a milk product wholesaler, he had been forced to shift away from credit sales and was supplying goods strictly for cash due to the recent increase in defaults by his buyers. “I used to supply to most shops on credit. Some of them struggled to sell and these products inherently have a short shelf life. My manufacturer doesn’t take back expired goods. As a result, these shops will default on their payments to me and I faced a situation where I lacked the cash to restock and was forced to reduce my inventory. These conditions have forced me to request cash on delivery,” he explained.He also stated the current high interest rates were proving to be a significant roadblock to his wholesale business because even collateralizedcollateralised loans carried an interest of around 20-22%. This reality is reflected in the Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPR) published by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on a weekly basis, based on the lending rates offered by Licensed Commercial Banks (LCB) to their prime customers during a particular week, which as of 20 January stood at 27.54%. Decreased demand Commenting on decreased consumer demand, Harpo Gooneratne pointed out that it was inevitable in the case of the restaurant industry because customers were forced to pay an additional 29.5% on their bills due to the recent tax increments. “They are forced to pay a 10% service charge, 15% Value-Added Tax (VAT), 2.5% Social Security Levy, 0.5% municipality tax, and another 1% tax.”Despite the gloomy near-term conditions, he was optimistic about the future of the industry. However, he stated that his current priority was consolidation and that he had no intention of pursuing expansion in the near term.A struggle to survive Colombo Chamber of Commerce (CCC) President Saranga Wijeyarathne warned that many Small- and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs) in the country would struggle to survive in the current economic conditions, particularly with further utility services price hikes imminent, due to their lack of knowledge on risk aversion and how to adapt to the current uncertain and unpredictable market conditions. He also admitted that it was likely that businesses would have to move away from credit sales to purely cash-based transactions on account of increased defaults as well as growing difficulties in obtaining credit services from banks amidst increased regulatory supervision. He further stated that amidst reduced consumer demand, businesses would have to contend with reduced profit margins. “When the economy is struggling, businesses will start undercutting and there will be a race to the bottom in terms of prices. Therefore, unless you have a monopoly in the market you will have to adapt. Businesses must be ready to operate on their minimum profit margins because what matters in a crisis like this is survival. You must look at your pricing models and work on minimum profit margins. Otherwise you will not be able to survive.”

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/BtQ2n5fel8Ms6svDOiKk,06 Jan 2023 | By Imesh Ranasinghe,‘Policy rates may not come any time soon’,"-	Analyst Dimantha Mathew says rates to come down in 2Q-	Central Bank says rates to moderate in ‘period ahead’-	Notes tight monetary condition to prevail till inflation well-contained The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) will maintain its tight monetary conditions despite a downward trend in inflation and keep interest rates at current levels until inflationary pressures are sufficiently contained, while market experts predict that the CBSL will bring down monetary policy rates in the second quarter (2Q) of 2023.In a statement released on Wednesday (4), CBSL said that the excessively high levels of interest rates observed at present are expected to moderate in the period ahead, as money market liquidity conditions improve and the risk premiums attached to debt restructuring concerns assuage. Moreover, it said that according to the near-term inflation outlook, market interest rates could adjust downward, yet maintain reasonably tight monetary conditions until inflationary pressures are sufficiently contained.Speaking to The Morning Business, First Capital Holdings Head of Research Dimantha Mathew said that the CBSL is expected to bring down its policy rates in the second quarter of 2023.Further, in its statement, CBSL said that it has already requested the banking and non-banking sector institutions to avoid unhealthy competition for raising deposits by offering high rates of interest, which has led to excessive adjustments in all market interest rates, including the lending rates, well above the adjustment of policy interest rates.“The market interest rate structure (of both deposit and lending interest rates) is expected to moderate in the period ahead with improving market liquidity conditions. If such adjustment would take longer than anticipated, the Central Bank will consider taking administrative measures, as appropriated,” the statement said.In terms of bringing down the market interest rates, the CBSL limited the availability of overnight liquidity facilities to Licenced Commercial Banks (LCBs), as the availability of the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) will be limited to fives times for a particular LCB in a calendar month, while the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) will be limited to 90% of the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) at any given day.===BOX===Three-month T-Bill rates drop by 60 basis pointsThe impact of the aforementioned statement issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka was seen at the Treasury Bill auction that was held on Wednesday (4), as the three-month bill came down by over 60 basis points to 32.01%, as Rs. 60 billion was sold after receiving bids over Rs. 178 billion, showing much higher interest when compared to the last two auctions.Mathew said that as investors are cut off from overnight liquidity facilities, there is a higher demand for short-term instruments, pushing the yield rates down.“There is a loss by not investing as there is nowhere else to invest, if you cut off the overnight (liquidity facilities), then the best option is to go for short-term (instruments),” he said.He also said that the other alternative for investors is to lend in the market for banks and primary dealers, which will improve liquidity in the system, and that the SLF limitation will not have an impact.========

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/ojEthPwVYGonnOZJCcRi,07 Mar 2023 | By Imsha Iqbal,Middle East to turn tide for Ceylon tea against global recession,"Tea Board optimistic of ME markets as recession effects spillover to the West    Despite hurdles, SL continues exports to Ukraine Despite the looming global recession, the Sri Lanka Tea Board anticipates that the demand of the Middle Eastern market for Ceylon tea would remain unaffected unlike most European market countries, The Daily Morning Business learns. Speaking to The Daily Morning Business, Sri Lanka Tea Board Chairman Niraj de Mel stated: “With tea being a much-sought-after beverage in most of the Asian region, they (tea products) are also strongly in demand in the Middle Eastern region. I don’t think the recession has affected the demand for tea in those countries as much, compared to the West.”While admitting that the tea revenue would be affected by the global recession, he said, however, that Middle Eastern consumers would even settle for tea when unable to have a proper meal. “We (the Tea Board) have observed a similar situation during wars, civil wars, and other various setbacks. We have even seen it in Ukraine.”In addition, he said despite forecasts that Sri Lanka would experience a permanent market closure for Ukraine in supplying Ceylon tea, Sri Lanka was able to export the products following a hiatus of a couple of months. He noted that even though the said country consumes 4-5% of the total tea exports, it has been a “useful market” in terms of revenue. While tea is transported to its destinations through various channels, the payable amount is reduced as a result of each party keeping a margin of the proceeds for themselves.  Expressing concern about the recession in European countries, de Mel stressed that despite it affecting Sri Lanka, he has faith that Ceylon tea exports would be able to survive.When encountering tea market disruptions globally, the Government of Sri Lanka is expected to contribute with minor efforts, since the market has been dominated by the private sector on a major scale for decades, even when building trade connections with buyers. Thus, the Government will offer incentives to exporters as a measure of generating foreign exchange or during price setbacks, with the option of buying tea at a tea auction set to take place soon.   Also, following the Sri Lankan rupee (LKR) strengthening, the export revenue is to be subjected to a reduction. “It is expected that the tea market will largely come down with the rupee strengthening,” the Tea Board Chair stressed.

It is by virtue of the powers vested under Section 19 (1) read together with section 19 (2)  of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA) that financial penalties are imposed on institutions for non-compliance with the provisions of the FTRA. The nature and gravity of the relevant non-compliance of the financial institution may be considered when prescribing the penalty.Accordingly, DFCC Bank PLC was imposed a penalty of Rs. 4,000,000 on 8 September 2022 to be paid by 7 October 2022. The administrative penalty was imposed for failing to adhere to directions issued by the FIU and non-compliance with provisions of FTRA (Section 2, 5 (b), 6 and 14  (1) (b) (iii)) and Financial Institutions (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 1 of  2016 (CDD Rules) 7, 8, 9, 10, and 27(2). People’s Bank was due to pay a fee of Rs. 2,000,000 by 11 October 2022 as per a penalty imposed on 8 September 2022 for failing to screen all existing business relationships to ensure that no business relationship is held by or linked to any of the entities or individuals included in the designated list under United Nations (UN) Regulations No. 1 of 2012, as the bank was found to be maintaining business relationships with persons designated under the aforementioned list. Bank of Ceylon was similarly subjected to a penalty imposition on 13 October 2022 to pay a sum of Rs. 3,000,000 by 14 November 2022  for failing to screen all existing business relationships to ensure that no business relationship is held by or linked to any entities or individuals included in the designated list as the bank has been maintaining business relationship with a person designated under United Nations Regulations No. 1 of 2012. National Development Bank PLC was subjected to a penalty imposition on 13 October 2022 to pay a sum of Rs. 1,000,000 by 14 November 2022. The penalty was imposed for failure to adhere to directions issued by the FIU and non-compliance with provisions of FTRA (Section 2, 5 (b), 6 and 14 (1) (b) (iii)) and Financial Institutions (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 1 of  2016 (CDD Rules) 7, 8, 9, 10, and 27(2). National Savings Bank was imposed a penalty on 13 October 2022 to pay a sum of Rs. 750,000 by 14 November 2022. The administrative penalty was imposed for the bank’s failure to maintain all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) lists of designated persons and entities under the United Nations Regulations No. 1 of 2012 in the  Extraordinary Gazette No. 2076/18 dated 20 June 2018, Gazette No. 2124/32 dated  23 May 2019, and Gazette No. 2140/16 dated 9 September 2019. Although lapses in systems and procedures were observed, instances of business relationships with designated individuals or entities maintained by National Savings Bank were not revealed during the on-site examination. The money collected as penalties were credited to the Consolidated Fund.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/ryJY7rWJVlZJjjIN6voM,05 May 2024 | By Imesh Ranasinghe,Banks not immune to NPL risks yet,"In conversation with Standard Chartered Bank CEO Bingumal ThewarathanthriEven as Sri Lanka’s economy recovers, its banking sector is not completely safe from the risks of rising Non-Performing Loans (NPL) yet and it might be too early to celebrate the reduction in the NPL ratio, said Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Bingumal Thewarathanthri, in an interview with The Sunday Morning Business. Supporting his statement, he cited the suspension of parate execution, which might play a role in increasing the ratio.According to Thewarathanthri, NPL ratios reported from the local tourism and entertainment sectors still remain at 30% and the appreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee has become unhealthy for exporters and even for the tourism sector to a certain extent. He added that the Central Bank’s intervention to control the rupee was limited through the new Central Bank Act and International Monetary Fund (IMF) directions and therefore the Government should look at providing targeted subsidies for certain sectors to bring about accelerated economic growth.Following are excerpts:During the economic crisis, the banking sector had to face a lot of uncertainties. Have those uncertainties cleared up now? What are the risks that remain?As a country, we have undergone a few consecutive stress-related years, starting from the Easter attacks. Standard Chartered’s proactive approach to business development and transformation underscores our resilience and dedication to delivering unparalleled service in the face of adversity. During the recent economic crisis, the entire banking industry faced severe challenges with some of the banks having extensive exposure to the Government. During this period, we were able to work together with the Central Bank to ensure that none of the local banks went into stress. Standard Chartered played a significant role by managing some of these exposures and providing a reasonable amount of time for the settlements. We also supported the Government with the import of essential commodities.The next big uncertainty for the country was the Domestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) programme. When it was announced, our primary focus was on understanding the impact in the event of a haircut (whether capital or interest coupon cut) being imposed and what the day one impact would be on the banking sector due to capital erosion. We were also preparing with regulatory forbearance and establishing a capital buffer at that time. However, in September, the DDO came to an end and the banks were excluded. I believe that decision was taken with a lot of thought to stabilise the sector and also with an expectation of the sector playing a large role in the economic revival process, in terms of carrying out more lending and having enough capital to support economic revival.The next risk we are facing is External Debt Restructuring (EDR). We now see a lot of data being publicised on how the EDR is progressing. The good news is that the banking sector has provisioned around 52% to absorb EDR shocks. While we cannot determine the shape and form of the EDR at this point, I can tell you that the banking sector is ready to cross the EDR now. We are waiting for a deal to take place and then do the bond exchange.In terms of underlying risks, I would say the biggest is the NPL book. During the crisis, NPLs went up beyond 13% and have now settled at 12.8%. We still cannot say that we are out of the woods from an NPL perspective. Some sectors, such as tourism and entertainment, are still at 30% and the construction industry is at 18%, while some of these numbers can rise. Overall, SME NPL is hovering at about 20%. While different banks have different NPL ratios, the industry average is still close to 13%, so we have to carefully look at how we work with these stressed entities or industries, revive them, and get them back on track for growth. What are your thoughts on the ISB restructuring? How critical is it to get it done as soon as possible?The local authorities and the bondholder group steering committee shared their Eurobond restructuring proposals on 16 April – a long-awaited announcement. The Government earlier communicated that the two parties had made good progress, coming closer to agreement on two of the four key discussion points, but had yet to agree. Talks continued on the sidelines of the IMF spring meeting and the IMF is already reviewing the ISB restructuring proposals.We think timelines are critical and expect an agreement by mid- to end-May; further delays would take it close to the Presidential Election timeline, which could delay the agreement. Bilateral lenders may also want to ensure comparability of treatment is met with respect to the agreement with commercial lenders. Sri Lanka’s official creditors and China will also have a look at the final agreement with the ISB holders and they will need to agree as they are yet to sign the final bilateral debt restructuring agreement.What is your outlook on interest rates, especially with an election coming up?Policy rates have come down and there was another policy rate cut at the last policy meeting and we expect another rate cut in the near future. Currently, we are managing inflation well. There are some risks, but there are positives as well because the utility bill cost has come down with the cost of electricity dropping. We also foresee the dollar appreciating by about 7%, which will be a huge benefit in controlling inflation. The Central Bank’s inflation target is 5%, with an upper and lower cap of 2% each. You have to operate within that band as per the new Central Bank Act. If it doesn’t reach those targets, it is answerable to Parliament. The Central Bank is well within its control in that parameter to manage inflation. Elections might not play a big role here. Of course, there’ll be a lot of spending, but the fiscal is improving as we speak. From another perspective, we have increased the number of tax files. Even personal tax files have reached close to a million now. There’s a lot of work happening to follow up with the high-net-worth and mid-level corporate entities. I believe that the Central Government will come closer to the stipulated revenue targets. There’s still risk in the revenue targets, but we are of the view that they will manage it. There’s also a lot of support coming from bilateral agencies.Why aren’t interest rates coming down as expected by the Central Bank?Though the AWPLR (Average Weighted Prime Lending Rates) have come down to 11%, the SME sector is still borrowing at 14-15%. I believe the Central Bank’s expectation is to bring down the SME lending rate to 12-13% to support the sector’s revival. It had rate caps or rate targets last year. With the policy rates coming down, local banks will be pushed to bring the lending rates down.Does Sri Lanka need a separate entity to deal with bad debt as proposed last year and can we see the NPL ratio dropping to single digits in 2024?In terms of forming a bad bank, I believe the time is now. It will not make sense to wait any longer. We have a toxic asset portfolio. We need to take that out of the banking system and support them with the two available options – revive or liquidate. However, we need a framework. Of course, there are tried-and-tested frameworks in the world. What is important is finding the capital. The question to ask here would be: who is going to put capital behind this? What kind of haircuts the bank will take is another matter that requires discussion. If you look at history, bad banks started with Mellon Bank in New York. There are tested good models of this framework, like what happened in Spain and Indonesia. If you take India, it also has a bad bank – National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd. – where it housed six to seven top Indian corporates with multiple multi-billion-dollar exposures. Our purpose is different: we have multiple SMEs and mid-sized corporations in the bad books, so we might have to follow the Spanish or Indonesian model, which handled a series of mid-sized clients. If we are to do this, the time would be now. It will be critical to finalise the framework, capital allocation, and who will do it and under which department before proceeding. On the NPL ratios, it’s difficult to predict right now, because we have now taken parate rights out and banks will not be able to use parate as a tool to negotiate debts. If you look at the number of parate cases in the past, last year alone there were about 500 plus, which is not a lot. There were many cases where the bank would send a notice and the borrower would negotiate and restructure the loan. Now that tool is no longer available. As a result, we see some sectors going into the bad books. Hence, we cannot be optimistic about the NPL ratios going down. We must wait and watch that space.Will the suspension of parate rights impact bank profitability and discourage private credit growth?The impact on bank profitability is one thing to consider because when NPLs go up, profits drop. I think, more importantly, banks will be reluctant to lend to vulnerable sectors. In the past, even if the cash flows were not great, banks lent money because there was always an asset at hand, so even for a vulnerable client, banks would provide about 70% of the forced sale value of the asset. That kind of lending will not be done by banks anymore.If you look at the entire automotive business model in Sri Lanka – especially the three-wheeler sector, the bikes, and the automotive – you would have never seen growth in these sectors if not for credit and repossession rights.Similarly, parate has really helped banks lend to vulnerable sectors and still recover, with the property as a negotiating tool. Now that tool is out, so I believe that lending to the private sector will slow down for certain sectors. Overall, it might ignite some growth, but certain sectors will find it difficult to access credit. Such sectors would predominantly be SMEs, whose cash flows are not very lucrative.Will parate suspension until December give some actual relief to sectors as parate execution takes more than one year on average to recover loans?Perhaps for certain sectors, if they are closer to a parate execution, as at that point they are thinking of disposing of some assets and settling the bank. But we believe it’s only a small group of people who will benefit; a larger group will suffer because interest rates will also go up for certain sectors.What are your forecasts for the rupee?Last year, Standard Chartered made a prediction of Rs. 325 to the USD and we actually landed at the predicted value. Our expectation for this year is a stronger rupee in the short run. The rupee has been appreciating like no other currency against all the hard currencies. I would say that the rupee has been one of the best performers in the money market space until recently. It’s not artificial, because we are not settling our debts at the moment.There’s a lot of rupees being accumulated because of worker remittances and tourism. If you take tourism alone, it’s generating about $ 300 million, while worker remittances amount to about $ 500 million, which makes up approximately $ 800 million a month. Our BOP or trade deficit for a month is something in the region of $ 400-500 million. So you’re accumulating about $ 300 million every month, while debt settlement for the moment is in the region of $ 150 million. This includes multilateral debts as well as India’s priority borrowing that we took after the suspension. When you apply basic economic principles, you can see the rupee appreciating as a result of fewer payments and more inflows coming in.The challenge though is that beyond a certain point it will be very unhealthy for exporters, even for the tourism sector. They will bleed; some are already bleeding. Beyond a certain point, some kind of intervention will be critical. But I don’t know whether the Central Bank can intervene with the new guidelines and IMF directions. The Central Bank had been buying heavily from the market and it has mopped up a net amount of $ 1.2 billion of dollar liquidity in Q1 this year. Plus, it is accumulating reserves to reach a $ 5.3 billion reserve target by end-2024. We believe that the bank can reach that target by H1.At the moment, there are rupee-negative conversations taking place. One is the crude price coming close to $ 90. This is without China’s full potential; if China’s growth goes above 6% and there is further stress in the Middle East, oil prices can rise. Some banks are predicting fuel prices to reach $ 100 in 2024. Standard Chartered though is predicting it will rally at $ 90. Each dollar of crude increase is a $ 4 million BOP stress for the country, so that is a rupee-negative event that we must closely monitor. Of course, if there are droughts in the country, the hydro percentage in the power sector will come down again and it will increase an element of thermal power usage. The other rupee-negative issue is if we have to pay interest on the restructured ISBs. If there is an interest component to be paid before the capital settlements, that is something you have to keep an eye on, as there is over $ 1.6 billion in interest to be paid.The fourth element is the opening up of vehicle imports, as people are waiting to import cars. Already you would have seen some high-end cars on the roads. If you open it up, we believe at least $ 500 million will go for car imports, as car prices have gone up significantly. These are rupee-negative events that can happen in the near future. If the dollar goes below Rs. 280, a lot of segments and sectors, such as exports and tourism, will really suffer, because their pricing is done at a Rs. 300-320 level to the USD, which is completely off by about 10-15%. Especially if you are on an advanced booking and it was done six months earlier, your pricing would be completely off.What are your growth forecasts for 2024 and 2025 and why?In 2024, we are expecting 3% growth; we are much more optimistic than some other agencies. We believe that in the second half of this year, salaries will get adjusted, inflation will come down, disposable income will slowly rise, and people will start to purchase. The economy will begin growing, led by tourism. Tourism sector-related construction has increased. Construction PMI and Manufacturing PMI have improved and crossed the neutral point. Hopefully, we will also see some amount of vehicle imports in Q4. We believe that our growth story will be much better towards the end of the year. For 2025, growth will be somewhere around 3.5%.Why hasn’t import demand picked up despite most import restrictions being lifted?The Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) has gone from 100 in 2021 to 200 in 2024. This movement shows that the basket of goods has gone up significantly. Now inflation or the propensity of prices going up is somewhat controlled, but the price points are at a very high level and salaries have not risen in parallel. Even if you lend at lower rates and even if the dollar is at whichever rate it is, we do not see demand picking up until income is stabilised and aligned with costs. I think companies and employers adjusting salaries wherever possible will be critical and that taxes for employees at the lower end – people earning less than Rs. 250,000 – should be reasonable, either low or zero. As for the rest, I believe that with salary adjustments and markets opening up, things should bounce back. We can’t rush this process, because after a debt restructuring any country will go through a difficult time. Sri Lanka has performed very well compared to other default or near-default countries. Sri Lanka’s story is excellent. We have delivered very well, especially in the external sector, but our problem is fiscal. Just because we have dollars in our reserves, we should not think that we are out of the woods. We must increase our revenue. Revenue to GDP has to be 15% and should reach 20% at some point. It is only then that we can say Sri Lanka is now stable.You need to balance revenue targets with growth targets. This can only happen through tax broadening. For that to take place, you require a digitised economy. What I mean is a digital ID for every citizen and company, online VAT registration, connectivity of Customs, Inland Revenue and Excise Department with banks, and the Department of Motor Traffic and Land Registry to be interconnected with Inland Revenue. That’s the most important underlying work that we must undertake. We should not be complacent because reserves are up and the rupee is appreciating.Once we get to a comfortable level with revenues, it is important to look at certain targeted subsidies for growth sectors. While we cap the amount of tax concession and have limitations, I believe some concessions are critical for FDIs. Depending on what you want to drive, I believe every country has tax structures that work for the industries that will contribute to their GDP growth. A review of those tax concessions will be critical, which Sri Lanka has never done. In a nutshell, we cannot go to the other extreme of no concessions. The country must balance its medium- to long-term growth plans with fiscal targets and debts.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/AK6mWa5wTQYuidWqdUV2,28 Jan 2024 | By Dhananath Fernando,Economic freedom and development,"This is a funny story (used as an example and not to conflict with any religious beliefs): there was a man who believed in a God who would rescue him from any threat or danger. One day, due to excessive rains, the man was trapped by floods and was confidently praying that God would rescue him. The first rescue team arrived, but he declined their assistance, stating that the God he believed in would save him, so no help was required. As the flood worsened, another rescue team arrived by boat, but he again declined, repeating that his God would be his saviour. Finally, a helicopter came and tried to rescue him, but he once more declined. He then died tragically due to the flood.After his death, he met God and expressed his unhappiness that God had not saved him despite his prayers. God responded: “I sent you three rescue teams, including a helicopter, but you declined. What else can I do?”The Sri Lankan story of development and growth is not much different. As a country and throughout our history we have held out a persistent hope for a ‘magical leader’ to come to power and lead Sri Lanka towards development. From mythological concepts like ‘Diyasen Kumaraya’ to the present, our focus has always been fixated on an individual or a political party. However, research indicates that development is an ongoing process and economic reforms require a sustained effort.The next question that arises is: if not a political leader or a party, what is the solution? How can we reach a resolution and what is the process involved?Economic freedom indicatorsThe process involves adhering to the framework of ‘economic freedom’. Countries don’t become developed and people don’t become wealthier due to any magic leader but rather by adhering to specific reasons behind development. The concept of economic freedom provides a framework to understand the rationale for a country’s development. In simple terms, when consumers have choices and freedom, they attract quality products and experience an improved quality of well-being.When consumers are free to make their own choices at a macro level, the ecosystem upgrades to meet higher standards through competition. This not only enhances living standards but also contributes to a decrease in corruption. The need to seek permission or approval often becomes a breeding ground for corruption. Whether it’s permits, licences, tax concessions, or selected projects, instances requiring approval or permission provide opportunities of corruption. Sri Lanka’s erosion of transparency and economic freedom is a good indicator to understand the correlation and causation.Sri Lanka is currently ranked 101st out of 180 nations in the Global Transparency Index for 2022, marking a decline from the 79th position held in 2012. This simultaneous drop in ranking aligns with poor performance in economic freedom, particularly in areas such as global trade and property rights.The fact that Sri Lanka finds itself in the bottom quadrant in terms of our performance indicates how corruption increases when countries really do not have economic freedom.Similar to the Global Transparency Index, there is another index that global investors use to assess countries known as the Economic Freedom of the World Index. This index provides valuable insights into the economic landscape of nations.The data consistently demonstrates that countries with higher economic freedom tend to enjoy higher quality living standards, a more peaceful environment, increased income, and reduced corruption. The true value lies not just in the index itself, but in the underlying structure of reforms that drive the indicators.Economic Freedom of the World Index measures Size of the government Legal structure and security of property rights Access to sound money (low inflation and the value of money cannot deteriorate) Freedom to trade internationally Regulation of credit, labour, and business All the above mentioned key themes have sub-themes under each main pillar. Economic freedom and per capita income  Since 1970, when examining the average ranking of Sri Lanka under the Economic Freedom of the World Index, the country has, on average, ranked at the 75th position. In 2021 per capita GDP for Sri Lanka was $ 4,375. Comparatively, Pakistan’s average rank during the same period is 103rd, with a per capita GDP of $ 1,474. In contrast, Singapore has consistently ranked at an average rank of sixth over the last 51 years on the Economic Freedom of the World Index, boasting an impressive per capita GDP of $ 66,176. Similarly, Denmark, with an average rank of 13th, has a per capita GDP of $ $58,360.This indicates that economic freedom has a direct correlation and a causation with per capita income. When we explore the numbers on similar variables such as corruption and global trade, we observe that countries with more economic freedom enjoy a better quality of life.It’s crucial to understand that economic freedom is not a singular solution but rather a continuous process and the Economic Freedom of the World Index captures this dynamic. While it’s true that countries ranked higher in economic freedom may still face challenges and have their unique problems, the overall trend indicates that a higher degree of economic freedom contributes significantly to a higher standard of living.In areas like freedom of trade Sri Lanka has ranked at 156th out of 165 countries. The involvement of the Government in business, the bigger State sector, and the State owning over 80% of land are all pulling our economic freedom and development down. The Government’s role should focus on ensuring rule of law, protection of life and property, efficient enforcement of regulations, capable monetary policy, and facilitating trade through competent customs through ports of entry. If Sri Lanka is serious, the outlined process is the only way to transform into a developed country. Even if we seek God’s help for development, the process has to be in place. Otherwise, our destination may not differ much from the man who waited for God to rescue him.

Had we been able to get them in November, we were targeting 19 December for the next IMF board meeting (to obtain IMF approval),” he said.However, he added that Sri Lanka had missed that target due to certain reasons that he was not at liberty to disclose.Moreover, he said that there was a delay in sharing information with all creditors on an equal, comparable, and open basis, as Sri Lanka was unable to share the necessary information with all creditors at the same time.However, the Governor said that, as reported by the media, several partners such as Paris Club member nations, India, and China have already indicated their willingness to support Sri Lanka.However, he said that Sri Lanka needs to get its creditors to agree to express their willingness to extend financial assistance in a formal statement to the IMF, which will then need a maximum of two to three weeks before External Board approval is obtained for the Extended Fund Facility (EFF).He said that Sri Lanka is almost done with the process, and added that if the country can get the necessary financial assurances in December, the IMF's Executive Board can then approve the programme in January.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/qsghEw06WhW5BTI5s7Jg,10 Jan 2024,‘Tax evaders must be brought into tax net’: State Minister,"State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said incorporating 500,000 of tax evaders into the tax system, could achieve the goal of decreasing indirect taxes and increasing the direct tax rate while Sri Lanka has one million individuals with the financial capacity to pay income tax.  The State Minister underscored: “In developed nations, being a taxpayer is acknowledged as a sign of a robust citizen actively contributing to the nation’s stability.” He also expressed optimism that the citizens of this country will undergo a positive shift in attitude, thereby fostering development within the nation.These remarks were revealed by the State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, addressing the news conference at the Presidential Media Centre on Monday (8) under the theme “Collective path to a stable country”.The State Minister also announced that preparations are underway to commence the implementation of the Tax Identification Number (TIN) number from 1 February, it added.State Minister Ranjith Siambalapitiya further stated: “At the end of 2019, the number of tax files stood at 1,705,233, which decreased to 437,547 by the end of 2022. However, with the new policies of our government, we have increased the number of tax files to 1,002,029 by December 31, 2023. Nevertheless, there is a need for further increase in that figure.”Additionally, by the end of last year, the state revenue which was 8% as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), has increased to 10%. The Government aims to further elevate it to 12% by the end of 2024 and set a target of reaching 15% by the year 2025 to establish a country with a stable economy, he said. He noted: “It is crucial for everyone to bear in mind that we are striving to maintain a 5% inflation rate in a country currently facing a 70% inflation rate. Despite this challenging situation, the government has worked diligently to increase the salaries and pensions of public service workers, showcasing the unique aspect of our financial management capabilities.”Presently, direct taxes constitute 30%, while indirect taxes make up 70% of the tax structure. The objective is to shift this balance and raise the direct tax rate to 40%. This adjustment aligns with the conditions of developed countries and promotes social justice. Registration issues are currently being encountered, primarily because this is a new experience for the people. Efforts are being made to address these challenges at the Divisional Secretariat level, with the intention of resolving them through an online system. He reiterated: “Recognising a taxpayer as a strong citizen contributing to a country’s stability is a principle upheld in developed countries. It is imperative for the people to embrace this change in attitude for the overall development of the country. Therefore, the success of this programme relies on the contribution of each individual”.

I think that’s what you all should do and if you can keep that momentum in the next few days, it will be very helpful. This is about the best that we can achieve. With this comes the fact that our interest rates will come down. It’s a matter of months before it comes down. Secondly, the development assistance will start, which will be a boost to a part of the construction sector.”He said by engaging in widespread explanations, stakeholders can grasp the nuances of the restructuring and gauge its influence on their livelihoods.President Wickremesinghe noted that the foremost effect of this restructuring endeavour is the anticipated reduction in interest rates, providing a glimmer of hope for individuals burdened by financial obligations. While the exact timeline remains uncertain, experts predict a noticeable decline in interest rates within a matter of months.Moreover, the President said as part of this restructuring, an injection of development assistance is on the horizon, poised to breathe new life into the construction sector. This infusion of support has the potential to stimulate growth, create employment opportunities, and invigorate the overall economy.

The Government should take measures to reduce its costs, turn around loss-making State-Owned Enterprises, and take strict action to collect taxes and recover outstanding loans from those evading payment, all without putting additional burdens on the people.Due to the vehicle import suspension and difficulty in importing and retailing spare parts, the motor industry lost over 10,000 jobs while thousands of SMEs shut down during the last two years. Even most of the large-scale automotive companies find it difficult to cover their costs. This will have a severe impact on proper maintenance of the fleet of vehicles in the country, of which 50% are over 10 years old. An unstable automotive industry will directly impact the transport of goods and people and the overall economy itself.DIMO Spokesperson In 2023, diversified conglomerates are expecting better stability, especially policy stability. They would also prefer a level playing field where companies are judged on quality of delivery, performance, ethics, and playing within the rules as opposed to connections and other criteria.  Sunshine Holdings Group Managing Director Vish Govindasamy 1.	Transparency in Government expenditure after increasing taxes and tariffs such as electricity, etc.  2.	Bring down the lending interest rates of the banks as SMEs cannot survive with the current interest rates. 3.	Have proper consultations with industry associations and ensure public disclosure before making policy decisions that will affect a country’s economy, such as the bans on fertiliser, palm oil planting, weedicide, etc., which caused considerable losses and irreparable damage to businesses and the country. Amend the laws so that individuals alone don’t make such decisions. 4.	Set up an inter-coordination centre at the President’s/Prime Minister’s office to coordinate the various Government bodies so that no one acts in isolation and all are well informed of Government decisions.  5.	Completely stop all Government/defence establishment annual celebrations of any kind and stop wastage.  6.	Work with media institutions worldwide and send positive messages regarding Sri Lanka to enable tourists to come to Sri Lanka. The President could speak on CNN/BBC and other travel-related media, assuring the safety and security of tourists.

The preliminary discussions in that regard have come to the final stage,” he said.He made this statement at an SLPP press conference held recently while refuting a statement made by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar during an SJB press conference who claimed that the country is unlikely to receive the IMF fund facility by March. Prof. Bandara responded to the claims saying that the aforesaid statement by MP Marikkar was “completely false”.Further, Prof. Bandara said their party is optimistic about obtaining the said support from the IMF and that the false statement was made to discourage investors, destabilise the economy, weaken the State, and topple the Government.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/hGMsbNDt4BbkwEhfTJqW,02 Apr 2023 | By Tanya Shan,Bleeding the Colombo bourse,"The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) coming on board with Sri Lanka’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme has not provided sufficient assurance or confidence to investors, at least not yet, as shown by the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) mostly being in the red lately. Fears of domestic debt restructuring are speculated to be the reason for this lacklustre performance and this article will delve into this matter. Bourse performance According to the data from the CSE, in January this year, foreign purchases amounted to Rs. 1.62 billion while foreign sales amounted to Rs. 1.2 billion, recording a net foreign inflow of Rs. 413.36 million for the month. Local investors were net sellers during January. The All-Share Price Index (ASPI) gained 4.42% in January while the S&P SL20 index gained 4.89%. Daily turnover average equity was Rs. 1.85 billion. Meanwhile, in February this year, foreign purchases amounted to Rs. 5.88 billion while foreign sales amounted to Rs. 3 billion, recording a net foreign inflow of Rs. 2.8 billion for the month. Local investors were net sellers during February as well. ASPI gained 3.65% in February while the S&P SL20 index gained 1.16%. For the first two months of this year, the net foreign inflows were recorded as Rs. 3.24 billion and local investors remained as net sellers. Meanwhile, in the first week of March, foreign purchases amounted to Rs. 575.73 million while foreign sales amounted to Rs. 459.44 million. Foreign investors remained as net buyers during the first week of March while domestic investors purchased Rs. 7.62 billion worth of shares and sold Rs. 7.74 billion worth shares. The second week of March saw a slightly different performance as domestic purchases exceeded domestic sales, recording Rs. 10.14 billion and Rs. 10.07 billion respectively. In contrast, foreign sales were less than foreign purchases as they were recorded as Rs. 835.2 million and Rs. 902.3 million respectively. It should be noted that during this week, the CSE rose to a five-month high in anticipation of the IMF bailout package. However, the third week of March witnessed a complete reversal of the second week trend. It should be noted that the third week preceded the IMF Executive Board approval for Sri Lanka’s EFF programme. As a result, domestic purchases were lower than domestic sales, being recorded as Rs. 5.83 billion and Rs. 6.44 billion respectively.  Meanwhile, foreign purchases were recorded as Rs. 1.81 billion and foreign sales were recorded as Rs. 1.20 billion. In the fourth week, following IMF Executive Board approval, foreign investors turned net sellers and domestic investors turned net buyers. Foreign purchases amounted to Rs. 601.6 million while their sales amounted to Rs. 1.27 billion, double the purchases they made during this particular week. Meanwhile, domestic purchases amounted to Rs. 9.52 billion and domestic sales amounted to Rs. 8.85 billion. Reasons for significant bleedingSpeaking to The Sunday Morning Business, First Capital Holdings Head of Research Dimantha Mathew said that the IMF statement mentioned debt restructuring parameters to be announced by the Sri Lankan Government in April and therefore while banking, diversified financials, and insurance shares had moved up in the last one-month period, shares were now coming down to due domestic debt restructuring fears.He noted that this sentiment in the market could continue until the parameters for debt restructuring were announced in April, as foreign inflows into the market had slowed down since foreign investors were also waiting on the announcement.According to Verité Research, Domestic Debt Restructuring (DDR) in Sri Lanka is complicated by the large holdings of rupee debt by financial institutions such as banks. As Sri Lanka’s banks are heavily dependent on income from coupon payments on rupee bonds (around 36% of their income stems from Government securities and this income is used to pay the interest on deposits and savings of the public), it would not be advisable to implement a reduction in the coupons. Consequent to a DDR that extends the maturity of domestic debt, financial institutions may need additional capital. However, temporary regulatory forbearance until yields return to lower levels can delay the need and size of the recapitalisation that will be needed. A follow-up note will explain a method for the recapitalisation that will sustain the stability of the financial system while maintaining the reduction in the debt liabilities of the Government.Balanced regulatory roleSecurities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) Chairman Faizal Salieh recently stated that the SEC was mindful of playing a balanced regulatory role with due consideration to both market development and market facilitation. He emphasised the need to safeguard investors while helping the market grow by doing the right thing the right way and added that stockbrokers were the front liners in the market who engaged with clients directly and therefore should act with due responsibility in advising clients and trading on the exchange.The SEC Chairman stressed the importance of self-governance at the market institution, market intermediary, and market operator levels and their responsibility to safeguard and uphold the public interest.  Salieh urged the participants to move away from short-termism towards long-term sustainability collectively in order to build investor trust and confidence in the capital market. He added: “Our capital market must become a good alternative source for capital funds like in other jurisdictions and that we are being watched by overseas and local investors on how the market behaves and is regulated.”A recent report by Barclays noted that the IMF’s restructuring scenario assumed that certain domestic debts would be reprofiled.The IMF itself said in the programme published two weeks ago that Sri Lanka’s authorities were “weighing different options” on how to treat local currency debt under local law.However, State Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe said that it was “too premature” to comment on a domestic debt overhaul, as a final decision on whether such a restructuring would take place had not been taken.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/S7ZwtDlB6bVOkMaTb066,29 Sep 2023,Sovereign rating changes ‘broadly’ balanced in 2023: Fitch,"Sovereign rating changes so far in 2023 have been broadly balanced, with 13 upgrades and 11 downgrades of Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Ratings, Fitch Ratings says. “The nett Positive Outlook balance has improved to -1 following 15 Positive versus 10 Negative Outlook revisions year-to-date, and is now higher for emerging markets (EMs) than developing markets (DMs) for the first time since 2014,” Fitch Ratings stated. Sovereign rating volatility has fallen in 2023 and is below its long-term average, following the actions driven by the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war and energy shock over the past three years. Average EM ratings in all regions have recovered from their all-time lows, but remain low by historical standards. Rating pressures generally have been greater on frontier markets than on larger EMs, noted the rating agency.“Fourteen sovereigns are on Negative Outlook and 13 are on Positive, although Negative Outlooks cover a much higher volume of sovereign debt (nearly $5 trillion, compared with $0.6 trillion). This is due to the presence of two highly indebted DM sovereigns, Belgium and the UK (which accounts for the largest share of the notional amount of outstanding debt issued by a sovereign on Negative Outlook). The net Positive Outlook balance is at or close to zero both for EMs (0) and DMs (-1) – the first time it has been higher for EMs in nearly a decade, partly because of EMs’ stronger fiscal performance since the pandemic,” elaborated the said ratings agency. EMs on aggregate did not experience the same pandemic-driven spending surge as in DMs. Spending restraint in many EMs was exacerbated by financing constraints as well as less developed public health and social security systems, Fitch said.  However, public finances in EMs and DMs benefitted from rising inflation from March 2021, which boosted nominal GDP and revenue growth. High commodity prices also boosted tax revenues for some EMs, explained Fitch Ratings. Fitch further said that aggregate data disguise considerable variations in fiscal performance among EM and DM sovereigns. Nevertheless, DMs may face greater fiscal challenges than EMs in the near term. The favourable fiscal effects of inflation are now fading as price rises slow. But DMs’ expenditure, which had stabilised in 2022 in the aftermath of the pandemic, has begun rising again due to a combination of energy subsidies, indexed expenditure, and higher interest costs as DM central banks have raised rates and embarked on quantitative tightening.Total DM government interest payments in 2021 were unchanged from 2007, at about $1 trillion, despite the total DM government debt stock doubling. In contrast, EMs’ rising debt over the same period of “lower-for-longer” DM policy rates has been reflected in rising interest payments, and they have not experienced a comparable payment shock in the past two years.Fitch expects roughly 30% of its rated portfolio to post wider fiscal deficits or smaller surpluses next year than in 2023. As well as those factors mentioned above, weaker global economic growth will weigh on revenue increases. The agency recently cut its 2024 world growth forecast by 0.2pp to 1.9% with widespread downward revisions, and will publish updated fiscal forecasts for rated sovereigns in their upcoming Sovereign Data Comparator in early October.The ongoing series of Global Sovereign Roundtables examines global rating trends and related issues. Presentations by Fitch Ratings will be made available on their website.(Fitch Ratings)

He said the new president has surrounded himself by young talent to steer the country in a new direction, with tourism positioned as a promising economic pillar.In this new chapter of Sri Lanka tourism, the country has shifted its focus from quantity to quality, with the Middle East region – home to a healthy mix of high-spending Emiratis and expatriates – being aggressively targeted.According to official figures, expats from the region tend to stay an average of four to five days and Emiratis for two weeks, enjoying luxury accommodation and experiences.Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau Director Marketing Dushan Wickramasuriya noted: “The UAE in particular is unique because 80% of the population are expat residents from places like India, Europe, the US and Canada. These are all key markets for us, so when we target this region, we’re not only reaching Emiratis but other nationalities as well.”Minister of tourism Harin Fernando, said the ministry has set a target to increase visitor spend from the current average of $ 200 to $ 250, to between $ 400 and $ 500 by next year.“The Middle East market is crucial as we are now seeking quality tourists over quantity. We slowly want to focus on the right markets and right people over numbers,” he noted, adding there are no plans to make Sri Lanka an expensive destination – instead it will appeal more to the “affordable luxury” segment.At ATM, Emirates also signed a Memorandum of Understanding to actively promote Sri Lanka as a leading tourist destination.(TTG Asia)

Moreover, the private sector has already requested land.” Therefore, SLCC will start calling local investors or the private sector within another two - three months time period. He stated that with the private-public partnership the SLCC is planning to increase their plantation by 10-15% in 2024. Currently, their plantation is restricted to Ondaatjie land and plans to expand the plantation by 250 acres this year.Moreover, SLCC will start cashew plantation in areas such as  Wanathavilluwa that has 40 acres along with few other lands that are owned by the Cashew Corporation. According to SLCC, in the coming years, and based on the cashew harvest they will plan to export cashews. However, some export companies of Sri Lanka already export value added cashew from their own private harvest or buying from the SLCC, he saidRatnayaka pointed out that the main reason for low harvest is the bad weather condition. Cashew is grown in the dry zone therefore last year's continuous rainfall had a bad impact on the harvest with falling down of cashew flowers buds. Sri Lanka consumes 25,000 tons of Cashew per year which is primarily the hotel sector. However, this year the cashew harvest has been between seven thousand to ten thousand which is insufficient. However, The Cabinet has approved the import of 15,000 tons of cashew nuts to address a shortage and support local industry where the lower harvest has left a significant gap between demand and supply.

Thilakaratne revealed that following multiple rounds of discussions, the first draft of the new National Trade Policy had been completed and sent to the Department of Commerce for observations. According to him, the content of the previous policy had been considered and updated in the new draft National Trade Policy. Commenting further, he stated that they intended to forward the new draft National Trade Policy to the newly-established Export Promotion Unit at the Presidential Secretariat for its observations as well.“Our target is for this new trade policy to operate in parallel to the new export development policy of the Government, which will last until 2048, and to facilitate it. Our intention is for this trade policy to operate for that period,” he said. He further revealed that the new draft National Trade Policy would be a comprehensive document covering both internal and external trade, prepared subsequent to multiple rounds of discussions with all stakeholders, and that the observations of such stakeholders would be referred to throughout the process. Moreover, he opined that they would be able to introduce this new National Trade Policy by next year. The current National Trade Policy was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on 1 August 2017 under the Yahapalana Government by the then Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade. The 2017 policy was to provide guidance on, among other things, FDIs, capacity-building, trade enhancement in and outside of the region, and access to international markets. Nevertheless, it has been reported that the 2017 policy was not formulated in consultation with the industries, thereby failing to achieve its desired results.Considering the need for another policy, former Minister of Trade Dr. Bandula Gunawardena had proposed to the Cabinet to appoint an expert committee representing all relevant parties to formulate a new national trade policy. The proposal was approved on 2 September 2020 and the Cabinet proposal said that a new policy was required, as the National Trade Policy that was drafted three years ago was not properly formulated.

Some 60% of low-income countries are in or near debt distress, but the Group of 20 (G20) common framework set up to help low income countries has failed to deliver quick debt relief.""At a broad level, we're really just pushing to improve the speed and predictability of this framework,"" Shambaugh said at an event hosted by the Brookings Institution think tank. ""This is going to require constructive and timely participation of all creditors in international debt restructuring discussions.""Shambaugh said Treasury's immediate priority was resolving outstanding requests from Zambia, Ghana and Ethiopia under the G20 framework, and from Sri Lanka, which is working on a separate debt plan since it is a middle income country.He said Washington was pressing for ""concerted action"" on Zambia's debt treatment and the formation of a creditor committee for Ghana in the next month, adding that the two largest economies in the world - the United States and China - needed to collaborate on these challenges.""At these meetings, we're going to be working very hard to speed up this process, make it more transparent and make it function better,"" he said, adding that progress had been ""slower than we would like.""A senior Treasury official said it was up to China whether Zambia's case could be resolved this week.Yellen and other G7 officials have long criticised China's slow movement on specific debt treatment cases under the G20 framework, although they have welcomed China's agreement to provide financing assurances for Sri Lanka, which paved the way for an IMF lending package.Debt RoundtableYellen will discuss the debt issue in separate meetings on Wednesday with officials from the G20 and the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, which includes debtor countries, Treasury said.The official expressed hope that the debt roundtable meeting would yield ""actual accomplishments,"" the official said. ""What we're looking for is concrete steps that will make the process operate faster, and in a more transparent way.""Sources familiar with the matter said the co-chairs of the roundtable – the IMF, the World Bank and India as current president of the G20 – planned to issue a statement after Wednesday's meeting.A record number of developing nations are at risk of a debt crisis, with ballooning inflation, escalating borrowing costs and a strong dollar jacking up the cost for borrowing countries to repay loans and raise fresh money.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva last week also took aim at China, saying she had told the country's new top economic leader that Beijing needed to ""speed up"" its work on debt restructuring requests.World Bank chief David Malpass said on Monday he hoped meetings this week with Chinese officials could help ""break the ice"" on badly needed debt relief for poor countries.Yellen has no formal meetings with Chinese counterparts on her schedule, but the U.S. official said officials from the Biden administration and China will continue dialogue ""where we're able to.""(Reuters)

However, the merchandise trade deficit has shown a tendency to widen on a month-on-month basis since recording a surplus in June 2022, it added.The merchandise trade deficit continued to remain low compared to a year ago, though it widened in November 2022 over the previous month. Earnings from merchandise exports declined in November 2022, mainly due to lower global demand, particularly for garment exports.While declines in earnings were observed across all main categories, industrial exports mainly contributed to the contraction in earnings. However, cumulative export earnings during January-November 2022 increased by 6% over the same period in the last year to $ 12,026 million, which was mainly driven by a 9.4% improvement in industrial exports amidst a decline in agricultural and mineral exports.Meanwhile, merchandise import expenditure also declined for the ninth consecutive month in November 2022 on a year-on-year basis, despite recording an increase, compared to October 2022. The decline in expenditure on investment goods mainly contributed to the decline in import expenditure in November 2022.However, merchandise imports in November 2022 increased for the second consecutive month, on a month-on-month basis, indicating the impact of recent measures to relax some import restriction measures and seasonal demand for imports. Meanwhile, cumulative import expenditure from January to November 2022 amounted to $ 16,865 million, compared to $ 18,396 million recorded in the corresponding period in 2021.

The UK is part of the Paris Club but presumably cosigned the amicus brief because it historically oversaw the London Club, the less formal group for private creditors to negotiate with sovereign borrowers.Last month, the Financial Times also reported that the United States (US) Government has also intervened in the matter where “the US is actively considering whether to file a Statement of Interest with respect to the pending motion to stay”.The Hamilton Reserve Bank vs. Government of Sri Lanka case was filed in June 2022 after Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy and defaulted on $ 1 billion of this particular bond issue, of which Hamilton Reserve Bank holds $ 250 million.

Tea export revenue for 2022 was $ 1.259 billion compared to $ 1.324 billion in 2021. According to the SLTB, although the volume exported last year was only 250.2 million kg, recording a 12.5% decline compared to 285.9 million kg shipped in 2021 and netting marginally less than 2021, shows the continued high demand for Ceylon Tea, while the annual free on board (FOB) unit price of $ 5.03 per kg for 2022 compared with $ 4.63 per kg in 2021 also confirms the distinct preference for Ceylon Tea.The export quantity for last year was the lowest in 25 years. In 1997, a volume of 247 million kg was shipped, and since then, the annual exports have been rising, recording the highest-ever quantity of 327 million kg in  2014.Sri Lanka’s tea export volume is directly related to production. The 2022 production figures expected shortly will be one of the lowest in recent times.

However, banks say there are some customers who are unable to provide any evidence of their repayment capacity and in some cases, customers had been in default even prior to Covid-19.”Moreover, in a scenario where it appears to the LCB that it is highly unlikely that it will be able to recover the amount granted due to the customers’ lack of income, the LCBs cannot be faulted for resorting to parate execution. “LCBs cannot just retain these bad loans in their balance sheet. They will have to make provisions or recapitalise as required. Banks themselves must strengthen their balance sheets,” the source noted.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/ULF2WrifTX5XLbDaWOUy,12 Mar 2023 | By Madhusha Thavapalakumar,Will China serve the same noodles to all debtors?,"The Republic of China, which had been preventing the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Executive Board approval for Sri Lanka’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) by delaying a letter of financial assurance to the fund, finally cleared the path last week when it provided said letter to the IMF. The reason China was so reluctant to be a part of Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring was to avoid setting a precedent of restructuring the loans it had lent. China rejected a request made by the Government of Sri Lanka in March 2022 to reschedule the loans Sri Lanka had borrowed from China. However, two months later, China told Sri Lanka it was “open to playing an active role in encouraging the IMF to positively consider Sri Lanka’s position”. In July 2022, a Spokesperson from the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated that “China is ready to work with relevant countries and international financial institutions to continue to play a positive role in supporting Sri Lanka in overcoming difficulties, easing its debt burden and realising sustainable development,” and that Chinese banks were “ready to negotiate with Sri Lanka”.In late January this year, China’s Export-Import Bank (Exim) provided Sri Lanka with a debt extension, offering a two-year moratorium on Sri Lanka’s debt, and said it would support the country’s efforts to secure a $ 2.9 billion loan from the IMF. However, the debt extension was deemed insufficient for the IMF Executive Board to provide the nod for the island nation’s EFF. In a major turn of events, the Exim Bank earlier last week sent a letter of financial assurance to the IMF, which was acknowledged by the fund a few hours later. IMF Asia and Pacific Department Director Krishna Srinivasan stated that Sri Lanka had received financing assurances from “all major bilateral creditors” and that this paved the way for consideration by the IMF’s Board on 20 March the approval of the Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) reached on 1 September last year for an EFF programme. Now, the question remains whether China will be issuing similar letters of financial assurance to its other distressed borrowers and whether it will be willing to reschedule the loans certain debt-trapped countries owe to China.Countries that owe ChinaBased on the data collected from the World Bank, 97 countries are borrowers of China, the nation which is accused of ‘debt-trap diplomacy’ by the Western world. These countries are mostly located in Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asian regions. According to Forbes, China is currently the preferred lender to the world’s low-income countries, which owed 37% of their debt to China in 2022, compared to just 24% in bilateral debt to the rest of the world. The Nation Thailand, citing World Bank data in September 2022, noted that the countries with the highest external debt to China were Pakistan with $ 77.3 billion, Angola with $ 36.3 billion, Ethiopia with $ 7.9 billion, Kenya with $ 7.4 billion, and Sri Lanka with $ 6.8 billion. Bangladesh owes 6% of its total foreign debt to China, which is around $ 4 billion. According to Nation Thailand, the countries with the biggest debt burdens in relative terms were Djibouti and Angola, where debt to China exceeded 40% of Gross National Income (GNI), an indicator similar to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) but which also includes income from overseas sources. The equivalent of 30% of GNI or more in Chinese debt affects the Maldives and Laos as well. Sri Lanka’s debt burden to China was the fifth-highest overall in late 2020 and amounted to 9% of the country’s GNI.Debt-defaulted and distressed borrowers of China According to Tellimer Research, as of December 2022, eight countries could be considered as being in default on their international bonds – Venezuela since 2017, Lebanon, Suriname, and Zambia since 2020, and Belarus, Russia, Sri Lanka, and Ghana since 2022; nine if one includes Ukraine, which after its consent solicitation agreed to suspend payments for two years.Even though Pakistan has not defaulted on its sovereign debts yet, according to The Hindu Business Line, if the burden of debt restructuring were to fall largely on bilateral creditors, then China would have to shoulder a very large proportion of that burden and suffer the most losses. “While China may be willing to take a hit to help Pakistan, it does not see why it must take most of the haircut, while multilaterals like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank go scot-free. And, finally, even to the extent that it does take a cut, it does not see why it should allow the magnitude and nature of the cut to be determined in a negotiation led by the IMF and the governments that dominate it,” The Hindu Business Line stated. In October 2022, Pakistan requested China to roll over its $ 6.3 billion debt, but in February 2023, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. only approved a rollover of a $ 1.3 billion loan for Pakistan.Zambia is another borrower of China in debt distress. In August last year, Zambia moved closer to a debt workout after top creditor China agreed to negotiate restructuring terms, setting a precedent for a multilateral framework as other low-income countries struggle to repay loans borrowed from China.China’s approach to debt restructuring Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies China-Africa Research Initiative Director Deborah Brautigam’s research shows that between 2000 and 2019, China cancelled at least $ 3.4 billion of such debt in Africa while it restructured or refinanced about $ 15 billion in African debt between 2000 and 2019. Further, The Diplomat highlights that China had provided debt relief to countries like Ecuador and Venezuela, where it extended grace periods and restructured maturing oil-backed loans.While this applies to the Chinese Government’s interest-free loans, it is not the case with the country’s interest-bearing commercial loans, which can be restructured but are never considered for cancellation. China has been reluctant to offer generous debt restructuring on interest-bearing loans.In Kenya, China agreed to an interest rate cut and maturity extension of a $ 4 billion loan for a Kenyan railway project, effectively bringing down annual debt service costs.According to Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum US Chair Mark Sobel, China’s debt contracts are opaque and authorities may lack data, especially on private sector activity. He notes: “China is not a Paris Club member and asks why it should follow Paris Club-like policies when it is a key or dominant creditor. The China Development Bank claims implausibly that its loans are private. Chinese lenders are understandably wary of taking losses, not just due to financial reasons but also fears over public wrath.” Will the approach change?Former Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in Geneva Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka told The Sunday Morning Business that China had always been willing to help Sri Lanka and therefore had declared a debt moratorium for Sri Lanka. “They offered a two-year moratorium, which means Sri Lanka does not have to pay either the principal amount or interest charges beginning from 2023. It is not that China did not step up to the play; China did step up to the play. However, the IMF indicated that it required something more than or different from that moratorium, so China’s Exim Bank has given a second letter and we seem to be over the hurdle,” Jayatilleka stated. Further, he said that whether this letter would set off a chain reaction that China was anxious to avoid depended on the contents of said letter, which had not been seen by the public.“It is difficult to say whether the Chinese assurance letter will set off a chain reaction among other borrowers. But if China cuts Sri Lanka some slack, then it should also cut everyone else the same slack. It is hard to tell whether China will agree to do that with others as well. They may take it on a case-by-case basis,” Jayatilleka explained. With China’s approach to debt restructuring changing slowly yet gradually, it would not be incorrect to assume that China may be looking at debt relief, rescheduling, and restructuring programmes of borrower countries.

Bonds at 'C': Fitch,"Fitch Ratings has affirmed the rating on SriLankan Airlines Limited's (SLA) $ 175 million government guaranteed 7% unsecured bonds due 25 June at 'C'. The rating on the bonds is driven by the unconditional and irrevocable guarantee of the Government of Sri Lanka (Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating: 'RD').SLA did not pay the interest due on 25 December 2023 on its guaranteed unsecured bonds, or during the 30-day grace period that followed, triggering an event of default. This is in addition to previous missed coupon payments in June 2023 and December 2022, and the events of default triggered via the 12 April 2022 announcement by the Sri Lankan Government of a debt moratorium on several categories of sovereign and public-sector entities' external debt, as well as the ensuing non-payment of interest on the government's external debt.SLA's bonds are rated at 'C', factoring in Fitch's view of average- to below-average recovery prospects following a default, in line with the agency's Corporates Recovery Ratings and Instrument Ratings Criteria, and Country-Specific Treatment of Recovery Ratings Criteria. The bonds of issuers that are very close to default show little distinction between 'RR4' and'RR6' recoveries. Therefore, Fitch has not assigned a Recovery Rating to the bond.SLA's US dollar bonds are part of the government of Sri Lanka's debt moratorium. SLA's bond rating is based on Fitch's assessment of average to below-average recovery prospects to investors, based on Fitch's Corporates Recovery Ratings and Instrument Ratings Criteria, and Country-Specific Treatment of Recovery Ratings Criteria.Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade are an upgrade of the sovereign rating, factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade, Negative rating actions are not possible, as the rating is at the lowest level applicable to corporate debt instruments and for the sovereign rating of Sri Lanka, the following sensitivities were outlined by Fitch in our Rating Action Commentary of 28 September 2023.Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade are the Local-Currency IDRs (Long-Term Local-Currency IDR at CCC-) would be downgraded if further restructuring or a default on local-currency debt becomes probable due to an unsustainable debt burden or inability to raise revenue and the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR is at the lowest level and cannot be downgraded further.Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade are a sustained decline in the general government debt-to-GDP ratio that is underpinned by strong implementation of a medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy and improved growth performance, completion of the foreign-currency commercial debt restructuring that Fitch judges to have normalised the relationship with private-sector creditors may result in an upgrade.SLA is Sri Lanka's national carrier and the government has full control over the company. SLA operates as a full-service carrier with a network covering Asia, Middle East, Europe and Australia. The airline's fleet consists of 21 aircraft.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/FLVspoyYsCS6svcP5gUM,12 Apr 2024,"State-owned Enterprises: Losses cost Rs.141,809 per household","The soft pedalling by the Government to carry out crucial reforms of State-owned Enterprises is forcing taxpayer’s wallets to take the brunt of the hit, says Colombo-based think tank, Advocata Institute. Advocata Institute Chief Executive Officer Dhananath Fernando said, taking into account the upcoming election cycle, the Advocata Institute, urged the need to reform State-owned Enterprises (SOEs). Here it was said that irrespective of the government that comes into power, SOE reforms must continue. The cumulative losses of key 52 SOE’s in 2022 amounted to Rs. 744.6 billion, costing Rs. 1.7 million per registered taxpayer, Rs. 33,949 per citizen and Rs. 141,809 per household. Despite the sharp increase in tax collection, estimates of tax collection for 2024 cannot cover the losses incurred by these 52 SOE’s for the year 2022. “The delay in restructuring is impacting ordinary Sri Lankans the most and the longer it takes and it’s going to make it worse for Sri Lankan citizens and taxpayers irrespective of who comes to power in the upcoming polls,” Fernando said. “There's a 1 in 3 who don’t make 30,000 rupees per month in Sri Lanka hence putting more burden on taxpayers makes no sense.” It was brought to attention that despite the reforms that are underway, they have been running at a snail's pace. The current rate would be ‘just enough’ for Sri Lanka to avoid another crisis but not enough to put Sri Lanka into a trajectory to be competitive in international markets. Among the 16 recommendations highlighted by the International Monetary Fund, SOE reforms are reiterated to be of importance. Specifically the Holding Company as well as the need to include skilled and competent members for the advisory board.The cyclical nature of the debt of SOE’s and the domino effect it has on the fiscal deficit on the Government was described through the example of SriLankan Airlines. The possibility of a second round of debt restructuring owing to an inability to deal with SOE’s and their losses was explained. The need to divest SriLankan Airlines through transparent bidding process was implored as allowing this process to be politicised would lead to a zero sum game at the cost of the taxpayer.Advocata Institute CEO Dhananath Fernando reiterated the nature of SOE’s being utilised as vehicles for corruption in light of the lack of transparency with regard to financial reports. Here he identified that only a mere 52 SOE’s have released their financial reports to the public. He noted that revenue from income tax barely covers the losses established by the SOE’s. The losses sustained by SriLankan Airlines and the government expenditure on Samurdhi benefits was compared to conceptualising the enormous opportunity cost the people of Sri Lanka are subjected to. Advocata Institute Research Consultant Rehana Thowfeek expressed that the intervention of the State into markets has had a negative impact on consumer welfare. The cost of the inefficiencies are borne by the taxpayer to fill the pockets of politicians. Updates regarding the current reforms that are underway were highlighted; passing of SOE Reforms Act and a new Banking Act, the setting up of the SOERU (State-owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit) and the mandate of the Holding Company. “So far SOE’s have served the employees and the politicians and not for the ordinary citizens of Sri Lanka,” Rehana Thowfeek said. “We are nearing two years to the default but the needle of reform hasn’t moved.”The constant delays during the reforms process, in situations like SriLankan Airlines where the deadline for bids has been pushed back several times already only costs the taxpayer more money, said Shihar Aneez, an independent financial journalist. Last week, the treasury absorbed $ 510 million of accumulated debt owed to the state banks which is an additional burden of approximately Rs. 347,000 per taxpayer and approximately Rs. 98,000 per Sri Lankan household. Aneez further said SOE’s are used as a vehicle for corruption, especially during elections. “SOE assets are primarily used for election purposes by politicians as SOE's are a popular destination to create jobs while running billions in losses, which taxpayers have to stomach,” Aneez said.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/a3dpwZVJmLwvnG7ZeNDA,09 Jul 2023 | By Roshani Fernando,Fuel costs cast fog over glass industry,"The glass and glassware industry in Sri Lanka is facing challenges due to high energy and fuel costs, resulting in expensive manufacturing and reduced competitiveness in the global market. Additionally, adjustments in taxes and significant increases in excise duty on liquor products have led to a decrease in domestic buyer demand, according to industry sources. PGP Glass Ceylon PLC Executive Director/COO Sanjay Jain expressed expectations of a 20% increase in exports in terms of both volume and value this year. However, the high fuel prices in the country, particularly of furnace oil and LPG, are hindering growth satisfaction. Jain explained: “The cost of energy in Sri Lanka, especially for fuels like furnace oil, LPG, and electricity, is roughly twice as expensive as in international markets. This makes us highly uncompetitive and limits our ability to enter those markets quickly.”According to Export Development Board (EDB) statistics, PGP Glass Ceylon exports over 95% of the glass it produces. The daily production and packing volume for both domestic and foreign markets exceeds 310 tonnes. The domestic market accounts for approximately 60-65% of production, while the remaining 35-40% is allocated for exports. The company produces around 50-60 million worth of glass bottles and containers daily.India is the main export market for Sri Lanka’s glass and glassware, followed by Canada, Australia, and the North and South American markets.Furthermore, the domestic market has been subdued during the past quarter. Glass manufacturers have witnessed a decline in domestic demand over the last 4-5 months due to high excise duty and the impact of tax revisions, which have affected the purchasing power of the general public. Jain stated: “This year, we are trying to balance the domestic market and exports at a 50:50 ratio to compensate for the drop in domestic demand.”PGP Glass Ceylon serves the alcoholic beverage and food segments, as well as various local industries including pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and soft drinks.The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for the glass and glassware industry is approximately 5-6% per annum. While there is increasing global demand for glass and glassware, Sri Lanka’s high energy costs and local electricity rates have hindered its progress.According to the EDB, the high fuel and energy costs render it difficult for Sri Lankan industries, including glass, rubber, ceramics, and porcelain, to compete globally. The EDB has discussed this issue with the President and higher authorities, however a solution remains elusive until the country develops renewable energy sources. Consequently, some companies are now exploring alternative avenues for survival, the EDB stated.

Its assets were sold to Chinese-owned Key Safety Systems for about $ 1.6 billion (£ 1.3 billion).This is not the only issue Toyota has been dealing with in recent months.This week, the Japanese car giant suspended shipments of some vehicles because of irregularities in certification tests for diesel engines, which were developed by Toyota Industries.An investigation found that Toyota Industries employees manipulated horsepower output tests.The affected engines are used in 10 models sold globally, including the Hiace van and Land Cruiser sport utility vehicle, Toyota said.Toyota is also seeking to resolve a case of misconduct at small car specialist Daihatsu, after it admitted falsifying safety tests dating back more than three decades.Late last year, Daihatsu headquarters were raided by Japan's transport ministry and global shipments of the vehicles were suspended. The Government has since revoked certification of three Daihatsu models.When asked this week about the scandals at Toyota's subsidiaries, president Koji Sato acknowledged that workers had felt pressure to cut corners in an intensely competitive industry.""We recognise that not only people at the testing site but also management did not have proper understanding of certification,"" he said.Separately on Tuesday, Toyota said it sold a record 11.2 million vehicles in 2023, cementing its position as the world's top selling carmaker for a fourth year in a row.Its nearest rival, Germany's Volkswagen, sold 9.2 million vehicles last year.(BBC)

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/LKN4PlVp5oicCyox8oeS,20 Aug 2023 | By Tanya Shan,Banks rally back; record strong first half,"Sri Lanka’s Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) appear to have been rising up from the abyss they were pushed into due to numerous negative local developments since last year, as the banking sector’s H1 2023 financial performance portrays a recovery in the system. The half-year results for 2023, encapsulating the first two quarters of the year, spotlight an impressive turnaround. As a testament to this resurgence, the notable players in the sector including DFCC Bank, NDB, Sampath Bank, Commercial Bank, Seylan Bank, NTB, and HNB have demonstrated remarkable financial growth. DFCC Bank DFCC Bank has reported a Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 5,110 million and a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs. 3,205 million for the period that ended on 30 June 2023. This compares with a PBT of Rs. 331 million and a PAT of Rs. 513 million in H1 of 2022. The group recorded a PBT of Rs. 5,867 million and a PAT of Rs. 3,923 million for the period that ended on 30 June 2023 compared to Rs. 690 million and Rs. 824 million, respectively, in 2022. The bank’s Return on Equity (ROE) increased to 10.52% during the period that ended on 30 June 2023 from 5.04% recorded for the year ending on 31 December 2022. The bank’s Return on Assets (ROA) before tax for the period ending on 30 June 2023 is 1.62% compared to 0.46% for the year ending on 31 December 2022.The bank’s Net Interest Income (NII) increased 41% over Q2 of 2022 to reach Rs. 15,475 million by the end of June 2023. The impairment charge recorded an increase of 19% against the comparative period, thus standing at Rs. 8,096 million for the period that ended on 30 June 2023, compared to Rs. 6,808 million in the comparable period.NDBNational Development Bank (NDB) reported a post-tax profitability of Rs. 2.3 billion for the six months ended in 2023 (H1 2023), an increase of 37% over the same period in the previous year (Year-on-Year – YoY/comparative period). Pre-tax profitability was Rs. 4.2 billion, a YoY increase of 55%. This is commendable generation of value to shareholders amidst an industry climate that continues to be subdued and challenging. The bank posted total revenue of Rs. 66.7 billion for H1 2023, up by 50% YoY driven by sound performance of all income categories except for other operating income. NII remained largely static over the year and was Rs. 15 billion. Interest income of Rs. 63.2 billion (YoY growth of 70%) and interest expenses of Rs. 48.2 billion (YoY increase of 117%) drove the NII. Re-pricing of the lending book, in line with market rate movements and the increase in investment portfolio at relatively high rates, resulted in the YoY increase in interest income. Interest rates remained on an increasing trend until early June 2023, attuned to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s (CBSL) tightening monetary policy and increased policy rates. The bank has taken initiatives on a best effort basis to reduce the cost of funding at a faster pace than the expected downward re-pricing of the lending book, with the reduction in policy rates introduced in June and July 2023 of 450 basis points (bps).  Impairment charges for the six months ended 30 June 2023 were Rs. 7.9 billion, a YoY reduction of 43%, primarily due to higher impairment provisions made for foreign currency investments in the same period of 2022. Sampath Bank During the first half of 2023, Sampath Bank has reported a PBT of Rs. 13.2 billion and a PAT of Rs. 7.7 billion, representing growth of 46.6% and 8.1% respectively compared to H1 2022.The group’s PBT and PAT for H1 2023 were Rs. 13.4 billion and Rs. 7.6 billion respectively, reflecting growth of 39.3% and 3.6% respectively.Sampath Bank’s capital adequacy ratios continued to improve, with CET 1, Tier 1, and total capital ratios standing at 13.89%, 13.89%, and 17.36% respectively as of 30 June 2023. This improvement is attributed to several factors, including a Tier 2 capital infusion, profit generation in 2023, and a decline in risk-weighted assets due to LKR appreciation.Sampath Bank’s total assets increased by Rs. 97 billion (an annualised growth of 14.6%) from Rs. 1.3 trillion as of 31 December 2022, to Rs. 1.4 trillion as of 30 June 2023. Despite the rupee appreciation against the USD, the bank’s total deposit book grew from Rs. 1.1 trillion to Rs. 1.14 trillion during the same period, demonstrating strong customer confidence.Commercial Bank The Commercial Bank of Ceylon Group has reported a gross income of Rs. 167.668 billion, including a growth in interest income to Rs. 150.812 billion for the first half of 2023, achieving topline growths of 40.29% and 71.15% respectively.The group also improved fee and commission income by 22.27% to Rs. 14.377 billion, net fee and commission income by 19.30% to Rs. 10.591 billion, and net other operating income by 236.42% to Rs. 17.086 billion, from a loss of Rs. 12.524 billion recorded for the first half of 2022.However, with interest expenses for the six months rising by Rs. 65.958 billion or 139.14% to Rs. 113.362 billion, the group’s net interest income reduced by 8.01% to Rs. 37.450 billion. The group also recorded a net loss from trading of Rs. 15.531 billion, as a result of realised and unrealised losses from forwards, spot and swap transactions owing to the appreciation of the rupee in the review period, in contrast to a net gain of Rs. 32.102 billion from trading in the corresponding six months of the previous year.Total operating income of the group declined by 27.03% to Rs. 50.520 billion, but net operating income for the period under review improved by 9.69% to Rs. 37.309 billion, with the group making a provision of Rs. 13.211 billion for impairment charges and other losses for the six months. Impairment charges for 2022 included a substantial additional provision made for foreign currency-denominated Government securities owing to the downgrading of Sri Lanka’s sovereign rating. Seylan Bank Seylan Bank has recorded a PBT of Rs. 4.2 billion, a 104.65% increase for H1 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. In addition, the bank achieved a PAT of Rs. 2.6 billion, a 71.29% growth over the corresponding period in the previous year.The overall Statutory Liquid Assets Ratio (SLAR) was 32.30% as of H1 2023, ensuring the ability to meet and exceed regulatory requirements and support operations effectively. Additionally, reflecting its commitment to maintain a robust financial foundation, Seylan Bank continues to be well capitalised, boasting a total Capital Adequacy Ratio of 15.51% as of H1 2023. Demonstrating a further prudent approach is the well-maintained Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio at 11.85%.Notably, Seylan Bank’s NII increased by 21.47%, reaching Rs. 20.5 billion, while the Net Interest Margin remained steady at 6%. The bank’s net fee-based income also experienced robust growth of 26.72%, amounting to Rs. 3.5 billion, driven by increased earnings from debit and credit card-related income, commission on guarantees, and remittances. Impairment charges decreased by 15.88% from the previous year.NTBNations Trust Bank (NTB), in the first half of this year, has reported a PBT of Rs. 12.6 billion, up by 174% YoY and a PAT of Rs. 6.1 billion, supported by a 35% growth in operating income (YoY).  Supporting the bank’s financial performance is its strong capital position with Tier I capital at 15.35% and total Capital Adequacy Ratio at 17.17%, well above the regulatory requirement of 8.5% and 12.5% respectively. During H1 2023, loan impairment charges reduced by 56%, reflecting the bank’s dedication to prudent risk management practices and due to the absence of high impairment charges booked in the previous year in relation to foreign currency-denominated Government securities. The bank reported an ROE of 24.9%, while its Earnings Per Share for H1 ’23 increased to Rs. 19.14 against Rs. 8.45 recorded during the same period last year. During the reporting period, the bank’s tax expenses increased by Rs. 239% to Rs. 6.5 billion due to the increase in earnings and in line with the increase in tax rates from the fourth quarter of the preceding year. HNBHatton National Bank (HNB) has posted a H1 2023 PBT of Rs 13.6 billion, while H1 2023 PAT stands at Rs. 8.6 billion, growing 56% YoY. Meanwhile, the group made a consolidated PBT and PAT of Rs. 15.2 billion and Rs. 9.8 billion respectively.Although interest rates tapered off towards the latter part of Q2 2023, H1 2023 rates still remained relatively higher when compared with the corresponding period in 2022, enabling the bank to report a net interest income of Rs. 59.3 billion in H1 2023, up 48% YoY. Additionally, net fee and commission income grew by 12% YoY to Rs. 8 billion, driven by increased activity in cards, remittances, trade, and digital platforms. On the back of improved foreign inflows and the consequent rising dollars in circulation, the rupee appreciated by approximately 15% YoY in the first six months of 2023. Currency volatility caused the bank to record a net exchange loss of Rs. 3.8 billion for H1 2023, primarily stemming from revaluation losses of Foreign Currency Banking Unit (FCBU) retained earnings.In terms of impairment provisions, the bank recorded a cumulative impairment of Rs. 28.3 billion in H1 2023 which included impairment on loans and advances as well as on investments in foreign currency-denominated Government securities. OutlookSpeaking to The Sunday Morning Business, First Capital Chief Research and Strategy Officer Dimantha Mathew stated that while the first half’s performance was undoubtedly better than the previous year, it could still be classified as ‘weak’. His objective assessment underscored the underlying complexities that influence the sector’s performance.He noted: “The first half is better, compared to last year, but it is still a weak first half, from what we have seen. With the recovery of the economy, we are expecting a slightly better second half performance with private sector growth also likely to take place – this contracted in the first half.”His rationale was grounded in the anticipation of an economic recovery, a pivotal factor that would potentially facilitate improved business prospects. “We are also expecting a reduction in employment and employment charges. With the recovery of the economy, we are expecting business to do slightly better, which may bring down impairment for most banks.”

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/h8HSjeFg5JAqu22r0dbs,05 Mar 2024,SLT Group posts 7.5% revenue degrowth,"For the fourth quarter (Q4) 2023, SLT Group reported a year-on-year consolidated revenue degrowth of 7.5% amounting to Rs. 26 billion compared to Rs. 28 billion in 2022 in the financial year ending 31 December 2023. SLT-Mobitel Group CEO Janaka Abeysinghe noted: “Looking ahead, macro-economic uncertainty persists. Despite the year-on-year decline in profitability, we are optimistic and see encouraging signs for 2024. Our cost base is under continuous review and adjusted to match market conditions. Given these fundamental strengths, we believe we will overcome negatives in these challenging markets and are confident in driving the long-term profitability of the Group.” The Group’s profits decline was attributed to reduced revenue, despite the efforts of cost optimization measures that resulted in a 5.9% reduction in Operating Expenses (Opex). Consequently, the Group saw a corresponding decline in operating profit, with both Profit Before Tax (PBT) and Profit After Tax (PAT) experiencing decreases in the quarter.At SLT level, a 3.6% Opex reduction was posted for Q4 2023 compared to Q2 in 2022, attributed mainly to a well-managed cost reduction in staff costs. Further, SLT saw cost savings in other areas credited due to a reduction in advertising and activation costs, with repair and maintenance costs also decreasing during the latter part of 2023. However, these savings were outweighed by a fall in the top line and increase in depreciation, driving overall losses.Overall, in the financial year of 2023, the Group’s operational costs rose by 9.4% to Rs. 74 billion compared to Rs. 68 billion in 2022, mainly due to increased electricity tariffs. Additionally, other costs, including, annual maintenance contract costs, vehicle hiring, fuel, and repair costs, contributed to the overall cost increase year-on-year.Furthermore, over the twelve-month period of 2023, the Group experienced a loss of Rs. 3.9 billion, contrasting sharply with the profit of Rs. 4.8 billion recorded in 2022, reflecting a staggering decline of 182.3%. Similarly, SLT and Mobitel individually reported losses of Rs. 1.1 billion and Rs. 3.6 billion for the year, respectively. Additionally, the Group’s revenue experienced a marginal degrowth of 1.2%, amounting to Rs. 106.4 billion, compared to the revenue of Rs. 107.7 billion in the financial year of 2022.Offering a positive trend compared to Q3 in 2023, the Group recorded a 13.2% reduction in Opex from Q3 to Q4 and a decrease in net losses from Rs. 1.5 billion in Q3 to Rs. 1.2 billion in Q4. Moreover, the Group recorded an operating profit of Rs. 549 million in Q3 in 2023, followed by a surge to Rs. 1.2 billion in Q4 in 2023, indicating optimistic future forecasts.Despite the performance decline over previous year, Mobitel showed a 3% growth in revenue and improvement in profitability parameters in the second half of 2023 over the first half (H1) of the year.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/GeEnFv5qyGfKTk1tLQyj,16 Apr 2023,Sizeable public sector,"As pressure mounts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the Government to aggressively implement reforms, the authorities are actively trying to get rid of most State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), since it will jeopardise the country’s economic recovery if it has to keep funding these loss-making SOEs. Visible progress has been made by the Government on this matter. However, amidst these developments, it appears that the need to reduce the massive public sector workforce has been conveniently swept under the rug. While it is true that SOEs are being reformed and hence the excessive SOE workforce will be redirected to some other areas of the economy, what will the Government do about the excessive workforce in the ministries and various departments? While the Government is looking at divesting its shares in SOEs, the workforce, which is heating up the chairs at ministries and departments, remains the same size, with no update from the Government’s end on reducing the public sector workforce. In the modern world where most activities are automated, Sri Lanka still remains heavily reliant on manual ways of completing tasks and getting work done, either due to the large trade unions that are against all possible development measures or due to the lack of fund allocation towards improving the information and communication technology infrastructure. The Government continues to allocate a massive amount of money for defence purposes and to pay public sector wages. It has, on many occasions, printed money just to pay the salaries of State workers. While Sri Lanka had Central Bank governors who believed in Modern Monetary Theory, which states that money printing does not cause inflation, in Sri Lanka’s case, it very much did. Yet, we continued printing money just to pay salaries, rather than using the money to increase the efficiency of the public sector. This is another concern; even with an excessive public sector workforce, Sri Lanka is still unable to get its act together in terms of expediting the approval processes of investors by cutting down the lengthy and lethargic bureaucratic requirements. The subject Minister recently stated that a large number of files pertaining to approval of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) to Sri Lanka had been languishing at different line ministries for years. This highlights the level of efficiency and performance of the staff at these line ministries. While there are still a handful of dedicated public sector employees, most have become comfortable with simply having an extended lunch break, two tea breaks, prolonged chats, and leaving work at 4 p.m. sharp. Even with an overpopulated public sector, Sri Lanka has been unable to get the bureaucratic processes for investor approvals sorted. However, taxpayers continue to pay the salaries of such employees who help to delay or effectively discourage investments. This is just one example out of many such issues within ministries. Along with SOE reforms, it is imperative that the Government also actively takes measures to reduce the overpopulated public sector and repurpose it either towards other initiatives of the Government (that too after rigorous training on efficiency) or direct it towards the private sector, where employees are rewarded for nothing but their efficiency and hard work.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/hDX4d2pkhKLHidFvqrRu,15 May 2023,Emirates creates $ 200 mn aviation sustainability fund,"Emirates, the international airline, has announced it has committed $ 200 million to fund research and development (R&D) projects focussed on reducing the impact of fossil fuels in commercial aviation.Emirates Airline President Sir Tim Clark said: “We are ring-fencing $ 200 million to invest in advanced fuel and energy solutions for aviation, which is where airlines currently face the biggest impediment in reducing our environmental impact. We looked long and hard at the reality we face in commercial aircraft and engine technology, fuel supply chain, and our industry’s regulatory and eco-system requirements. It’s clear that with the current pathways available to airlines in terms of emissions reduction, our industry won’t be able to hit net zero targets in the prescribed timeline.“This is the biggest single commitment by any airline on sustainability, with funds to be disbursed over three years. Emirates will identify partnerships with leading organisations working on solutions in advanced fuel and energy technologies.“We believe our industry needs better solutions, and that’s why we’re looking to partner with leading organisations on R&D. Our aim is to contribute meaningfully to practical solutions for the long-term sustainability of commercial aviation,” he said.Emirates’ Environmental Sustainability Executive Steering Group will oversee disbursements from the fund, with support from technical experts.Clark added: “Until viable solutions can be found, Emirates will continue to implement environmentally responsible practices throughout our business, including uplifting SAF where feasible, ensuring efficient fleet operations, and inducting modern aircraft into our fleet. Our $ 200 million fund is earmarked for R&D, and not for operating costs like the purchase of SAF or carbon offsets to tick regulatory boxes – activities we consider business-as-usual.”Emirates’ long-standing environmental policy and strategy focuses its activities on 3 areas: emissions reduction, responsible consumption, and the conservation of wildlife and habitats.In January, Emirates completed the first 100% SAF-powered demonstration flight in partnership with Boeing and GE. Since its first flight powered by SAF in 2017, the airline continues to participate actively in the SAF market and seek opportunities in its network to use SAF where feasible.However, bio-based SAF, currently the only type of commercially available SAF, is extremely limited in supply. IATA estimates that the entire world’s annual supply of SAF meets less than 0.1% of airlines’ needs.Emirates participates in a range of industry working groups and stakeholder engagements on sustainable aviation fuel. In recent months, the airline contributed to the development of the UAE’s power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels roadmap, launched in July 2022, and prepared jointly by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure and the World Economic Forum; as well as the UAE’s National Sustainable Aviation Fuel Roadmap launched in January 2023 by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure.Emirates’ investment in flying a young and modern aircraft fleet remains its biggest commitment to reducing its emissions. The airline currently has 200 of the latest Airbus and Boeing wide-body aircraft on order, including A350s and 777Xs.

Thereafter, the Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee will engage with them and come to a decision.”While noting that expecting a decision by end-2023 was too optimistic, he said that the Government was motivated and committed to ensuring that the privatisation process was completed as soon as possible.The privatisation plan of the Government in relation to SriLankan Airlines essentially involves the Government continuing to retain a 51% stake while divesting a 49% stake in the national airline to an investor who can provide a capital injection of around $ 500 million.The bankrupt national airline reportedly owes around $ 1.2 billion to international markets, State banks, and fuel suppliers, from which around $ 100 million is owed to the aircraft lessors and $ 175 million is owed to the holders of the Government-guaranteed bond, on which the airline has already defaulted.On 25 January, SriLankan Airlines defaulted on its $ 175 million Government-guaranteed bond due in 2024 (ISIN iXS2010609662) with an annual coupon payment of 7% payable semi-annually, after the expiration of the 30-day grace period following its failure to make the coupon payments due on 25 December 2022.The sole silver lining is that despite the present calamitous condition of the national carrier, it managed to record an operating profit of $ 53 million for 2022 – the first time the bottom line of the airline has been in the green in over 15 years

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/apgWICOpMq5m8f6TAFnv,19 Jul 2023,Eran presents Private Member’s Bill to amend SCL Act,"Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Parliamentarian Eran Wickramaratne presented a Private Member’s Bill to Parliament yesterday (18) to amend the Special Commodity Levy (SCL) Act No. 48 of 2007. Commenting on the matter, Wickramaratne said: “I am presenting a private member’s bill to amend the Special Commodity Levy Act No. 48 of 2007 as the people of Sri Lanka are calling for more accountability and transparency with regard to public finances in the country. This amendment is to promote fiscal accountability and ensure that decisions on taxation are transparent and are discussed in the public domain.” He stated that the Finance Minister has complete discretion to change the tax and announce it through a gazette notification Under the current SCL legislation and the tax change comes into effect immediately on the Minister’s signature. It is brought for parliamentary approval much later in the process. “However, Article 148 of Sri Lanka’s constitution grants control over public finances to the Parliament. The Special Commodity Levy Act, as currently enacted, violates this constitutionally protected mandate of parliament, and instead provides sweeping discretionary powers to the Minister to not only change the tax rate, but also to provide tax exemptions,” Wickrmaratna said in a statement.    Even if an action taken by the Minister under this act later fails to gain the approval of Parliament, the implementation of those actions prior to it coming to parliament cannot be reversed, but only discontinued. This leaves an extraordinary amount of power in the minister’s hands and leaves room for the tax system to be abused in favour of vested interests and for huge losses to be caused to government revenue – which must then be made up through other taxes.    The amendment presented by Wickramaratne seeks to establish parliamentary control over any changes to the SCL and prevent the Minister from abusing statutory powers, including by granting benefits to a chosen few. The notorious ‘sugar scam’ of 2020 also originated from these discretionary powers of the Minister. Prior to October 2020, sugar was taxed at Rs. 50 per kilogram (kg), but then was drastically reduced to 25 cents per kg. Analysis published on PublicFinance.lk shows that the benefit of the tax reduction went mostly to the importer, and not the consumer.  According to the National Audit Office of Sri Lanka, between October 2020 and February 2021, the Government lost Rs. 16 billion in potential tax revenue. If that analysis is extended to December 2022, the Government has lost about Rs. 59 billion in revenue due to the reduction of SCL on sugar imports.   The Government in 2022 attempted to introduce a new tax through the Special Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill, which gave the minister similar powers to that which presently exists in the VAT and SCL framework. However, the Supreme Court, in strong terms, held the Bill to be unconstitutional and that it violated the sovereignty of the People.  The Court held: “Thus, by empowering the Minister in the manner provided in clauses 2 and 3, the Parliament distinctively and manifestly loses control over public finance and unconstitutionally alienates such power to the Minister. In the circumstances, this Court holds that clauses 2, 3 and 4 individually and collectively amount to an infringement of Article 148 of the Constitution read with Article 76, and by virtue of such infringement violates Article 4 read with Article 3 of the Constitution.”  The amendment proposed by Wickramaratne will bring the relevant portion of the SCL laws in conformity with the constitutional framework, as recognised by the Supreme Court in the Special GST Bill Determination.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/gWs3Qmgqzq9QRWLtFooy,27 Aug 2023 | By Malisha Weerasinghe and Dr. Asanka Wijesinghe,Sri Lanka’s graphite: A potential player in the global EV revolution,"Sri Lanka has a rich history of mining and exporting graphite, which thrived during the World Wars, hitting 35,000 metric tonnes in annual exports. The vein graphite produced by Sri Lanka stands out for its remarkable purity, flawless crystal structure, and strong electrical conductivity, making it suitable for various commercial uses. However, in 2023, only 2,792 metric tonnes were exported, yielding approximately $ 6 million in revenue. The emerging trend towards electromobility on a global scale presents fresh opportunities to revive Sri Lanka’s graphite industry. The newly established Chamber for Mineral Exporters has also emphasised the importance of well-defined policies to harness the untapped potential of the mineral sector.Graphite in EV batteries: Opportunities for Sri LankaGraphite forms the core anode material in lithium-ion Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries, with quantities varying from 10 kg in hybrids to 70 kg in all-electric vehicles. Consequently, the US Department of Energy classifies graphite as a critical mineral. Projections indicate global demand for EVs will surge to 40 million units by 2030. Consequently, the demand for lithium-ion batteries for EVs has increased and securing sustainable and reliable Critical Raw Materials (CRMs) has become a policy priority. Purity, extraction sustainability, cost, and geopolitical tensions are vital factors impacting the graphite supply chain. The US industrial and national security policies aim to diversify the sources of CRM for EV batteries – cobalt, nickel, lithium, and graphite – away from China, designated as a Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC).As the primary graphite producer, China possesses 80% of battery-grade graphite resources and controls more than 50% of the processing capacity. More than 65% of the anode material supplied globally was sourced from six companies in China. Crucially, China holds a notable edge in productivity and cost when exporting natural graphite to major economies. Yet, China’s prominent role as the primary graphite exporter has raised concerns about ‘supply chain resilience’ among key Western importers, especially given their geopolitical aspirations.The Biden administration’s ambitious Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has excluded EV batteries that contain graphite of Chinese origin from lucrative federal subsidies. While this may lead to a relative price increase for EV batteries using Chinese graphite, it also drives up demand for alternatives. Sri Lanka, known for exceptionally high-quality graphite production, could benefit from this shift. With the IRA-induced increase in demand and trade restrictions on China, Sri Lanka’s graphite exports to the US could potentially surge by 65.7%. Positioning Sri Lanka’s graphite in global EV battery manufacturing Sri Lanka’s current graphite production stands at 5,000 MT. Yet, according to the Board of Investment, the potential production capacity reaches 450,000 MT per year. Given that Sri Lanka is a rare producer of the finest form of natural graphite in an environmentally less harmful manner, the country has an opportunity to tap into the growing global demand for ‘non-China origin’ graphite.There are several stages of EV battery manufacturing that Sri Lanka may consider joining: exporting natural graphite, exporting processed graphite in the form of electrodes or anodes, exporting lithium-ion cells, and exporting the entire battery pack. For a few reasons, the last two might not be within Sri Lanka’s feasible options. First, the general organisation of EV manufacturing is that vehicle production plants and battery pack production are located in geographical proximity due to logistic reasons. Second, the US’ renewed tendency to reshore manufacturing through active industrial policy limits attracting investors to Sri Lanka for producing an entire battery pack or battery cells. Thus, Sri Lanka’s most viable options might be exporting natural graphite or processed electrodes and graphene to the US, Japan, South Korea, and the EU-centred EV manufacturing production network. Policy recommendationsSri Lanka should take proactive measures to leverage global policy shifts and identify potential roles within the EV battery value chain. Thoughtfully crafted industrial and trade strategies will play a significant part in maximising the benefits from Sri Lanka’s graphite resources in the emerging landscape. Sri Lanka’s industrial policy should strive to identify graphite-based products with an existing comparative advantage, link the producers with the end-users, facilitate the acquisition of required technology for value addition, and remove the hurdles for possible mining expansion.Engaging private sector stakeholders in thorough consultations can help Sri Lanka strategically position itself in the competitive EV manufacturing ecosystem. Concurrently, industrial policy must prioritise environmentally sustainable graphite extraction and processing, leveraging Sri Lanka’s potential as a ‘non-China origin sustainable graphite’ source.A pivotal trade strategy involves forging critical minerals agreements with the US and the EU. A pact with the US enables Sri Lanka to process and export value-added graphite, aligned with IRA subsidy rules. Moreover, a formal accord with major graphite-consuming EV battery manufacturers fosters mining and processing sector investment by eliminating uncertainty.A burgeoning hub for EV battery production is forming in Thailand and Indonesia, with China, Japan, and South Korea investing in regional EV manufacturing. Agreements among countries possessing critical mineral deposits are increasingly common, motivating Sri Lanka to broaden its proposed trade deals with Thailand, Indonesia, and other East Asian nations into the EV battery value chain. Trade agreements should facilitate investments in graphite mining and the subsequent processing into electrodes and graphene.(Malisha Weerasinghe worked as a Project Intern in the Macro, Trade and Competitiveness Policy Unit at IPS.

A future shaped by third generation web technologies achieving mass adoption. The prospects were exciting to say the least. Not just for myself as a technology marketer, but for every future user of the internet, and in particular for the Sri Lankan technology industry, considering the opportunity that web 3.0 presents to truly transform the national economy. But, let’s start at the top. What really is web 3.0?Web 1.0 was the first iteration of the internet in all of its dial-up connection, text-heavy, eternally loading glory. Simply, the internet the way 90’s born millennials remember from their childhood. This form of the internet is the least important to my story.Web 2.0 is the broadly collective term for the internet as we know it today. While opinions may differ, in my mind, the web 2.0 phenomenon is based on a few foundational beliefs about the internet, its users and the nature of interactions between users and the internet.Dynamic content which responds to user input (such as search queries), application programming interfaces (API) which allowed inter-application communication, self-usage, interpersonal platforms such as blogs and social media, and cloud computing possibilities such as SaaS are all results of foundational beliefs associated with web 2.0.Web 3.0, on the other hand is arguably the most current theme in technology. Underpinned by an overarching theme of decentralization, the third iteration of the internet promises to be a semantic form of the web wherein data is stored and processed using distributed ledger technologies. While the prospects of blockchain technology backed data processing and an internet with the capability to recognize and respond to natural language sounds incredibly promising, my personal belief is that web 3.0 is a culmination and collective of many independent streams of technology.  To illustrate, web 3.0 will reveal apt use cases for bleeding edge breaktrhoughs in artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual reality and the internet of things, showcasing the true potential of each technological advancement in the most potent form for mainstream user consumption in personal, enterprise and administrative scale.Back to Decipher 2022, the Algorand community event which was held in Dubai recently.Algorand is a two-tiered blockchain protocol founded in 2017 by Silvio Micali, an MIT professor. For anyone familiar with the industry, Algorand is known to be a promising decentralized, carbon-negative, high speed, low cost blockchain solution. For the uninitiated, blockchain is a decentralized, distributed database technology able to record, store and transfer data in a secure, immutable way between users (peer-to-peer) without a central bearer of the cost of trust. Simply put, blockchain technology is the bedrock on which cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and metaverses are developed. And, in this scheme of things, Algorand is a key contender in the competition among blockchains to emerge as the face of the future world in which the internet has completed its transition to web 3.0.If the competition to discover the Google of web 3.0 is ongoing, Algorand is firmly in the running.Why should we care?Understanding why all of this is important to us in Sri Lanka, especially at this difficult time requires a brief historic inquiry of the domestic technology industry. As at 2019/20, the Sri Lankan IT-BPM industry generated $1.5bn in revenue, a 108% growth over the period between 2013 and 2019, and a CAGR of 13%. Constituted of 600+ ICT firms and 80+ BPM companies, the industry is the 4th largest foreign revenue earner for the country, and arguably has been the most resilient industry in recent years.With the local economy shifting its focus towards services, it’s also important to note that the IT-BPM industry accounts for 30% of service export revenue, and 12% of service foreign currency inflows in Sri Lanka.Further, over 88,000 Sri Lankan individuals are employed by the IT industry, and an additional 25,000 by the BPM industry segment; totaling to a tally exceeding 113,000 of the 8 million strong total workforce of Sri Lanka being employed by the IT-BPM industry. Finally, IT-BPM industry workers earn comfortably above the average pay rate in the local market, recording one of the highest per capita earning rates when comparing across all industries.The transformative impact that technology as an industry has had on the Sri Lankan economy and labour pool is clearly evident when considering the facts. What must also be recognized is that many of the market leading industry operators including local heritage bluechips in the calibre of Virtusa and WSO2, as well as MNCs such as HCL are all successful participants of the $3.3tn global technology industry which emerged from mainstream adoption of web 2.0 technologies. The bottom line is that Sri Lanka was transformed by the emergence of industry in the web 2.0 era, and we are now faced with the potential for capitalizing on the web 3.0 opportunity.   What does that opportunity look like?The purpose of the Sri Lankan delegation in attendance at Decipher 2022 was entirely premised on understanding what the web 3.0 opportunity looks like for Sri Lanka, and the region. Our delegation included a multi-faceted team including South Asian pop music sensation Yohani, entrepreneur and entertainment executive Dilanjan Seneviratne, blockchain advocate Sanjay Mendis, digital marketer Cleona Mark, brand strategist Banura Sooriyapperuma, and myself in the capacity of a technology marketer with interest vested in the potential for private sector exploration of the web 3.0 industry.At the event, Algorand demonstrated an impressive cohort of case studies to illustrate the true potential of not only the Algorand ecosystem but also the broader web 3.0 landscape.Among the success stories that were presented, a few truly stood out for me in consideration of parallels that can be drawn to Sri Lanka and the applicability to the local business context. NFTVerse, an NFT storefront project founded by Neel Kamal, a system architect based in India is one such example. The NFTVerse platform bridges the gap between web 2.0 and web 3.0 in terms of interfacing, payment infrastructure and tokenization of assets. The web 3.0 transition stories of Napster and LimeWire were also of interest purely from the perspective of understanding the potential for legacy brands to navigate their held brand equity from the web 2.0 era to web 3.0 by innovating at the level of their business models, and modernization of their core technologies. Dequency was another project of interest given their unique positioning as a platform for musicians and visual artists to connect and collaborate with NFT and metaverse outcomes in mind.Many other projects were of significant interest and strengthened the case for Algorand as a potential blockchain partner for future projects that emerge from Sri Lanka at enterprise and sovereign scale. Serendipitously, Algorand also launched their Indian operation - AlgoBharat at Decipher, bringing the opportunity closer to home. AlgoBharat is led by Anil Kakani and Nikhil Varma who are choice partners for any projects building out of Sri Lanka with the potential for partnership with the vibrant Algorand ecosystem.But, how exactly will Sri Lanka participate in the web 3.0 opportunity?In my view, the immediate web 3.0 opportunity for Sri Lanka will progress along six major business verticals.  TourismEntertainment, Music & ArtReal EstatePublic Sector IT-BPMBanking, Financial Services & InsuranceTokenization of real world assets will hold the most potential for many industries including tourism, entertainment, real estate and the public sector. If done right, these industries will attract foreign investments in the form of token issuances. Importantly, tokenization is viable within the current regulatory environment, an aspect that lends to the potential of such projects.On the other hand, the challenge for founders and businesses engaged in tokenization will be to maintain pace with advanced digital economies capitalizing on the first mover advantage. Regulatory clarity and forward-thinking leadership at policy level will be critical for the banking and financial industry. Liberalization of decentralized financing protocols and cryptocurrency trading will be among key concerns for businesses intending to engage in the financial service industries. Awareness and education are critical for the IT-BPM industry transformation towards building web 3.0 competencies. The readiness of existing organizations in this industry space will be stress-tested in coming years and productive exploration will yield lucrative rewards.In these terms, the coming years will be decisive as to whether Sri Lanka finds its feet in the coming web 3.0 era. The onus is collectively on regulators, businesses and the talent pool to drive progress and maintain pace with the global industry.Dilshan is a technology marketer and business consultant with over 12 years of industry experience engaging with top local & regional bluechips.

Meanwhile, the EDB is to identify the opportunities available in the export market, once the product is decided to be exported.“We are still at the beginner stage and we are looking at the varieties and products because if we are exporting cannabis products, it  should be value added also,” explained Dr. Bernard. Even though Sri Lanka will not export value added products at the initial stages, but will look forward to exporting such in the future, Dr. Bernard reiterated.    Recently, in a press conference, the State Minister of Investment Promotion, Dilum Amunugama stated that The Board of Investment (BOI) is to go ahead with the pilot project for cannabis. “We have authorised (the cannabis cultivation project) because the Expert Committee report is out. We got the instructions to proceed with the pilot project through the BOI. We are discussing with the investors and experts,” said the minister while giving the greenlight for cannabis related experimenting and a land for cannabis cultivation within an export zone. The Minister Amunuama further noted that not only cannabis cultivation is going to take place in the export zone but also manufacture cannabis products which eventually will bring an income to the country.   Emphasising the need for a policy and the establishment of a Parliament Committee last year, Minister of Justice Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe (PC) said: “There is a committee appointed within Parliament to draft the policy. We cannot draft a Bill without a policy. If we can do it in a separate zone with full-fledged security, only for export purposes, we can make the relevant laws.” When The Daily Morning Business inquired Dr. Bernard on the current situation with the regulations that the country is to put forward in safeguarding the foreign currency inflows to the country, he responded saying that it is “too premature” to make a comment in that regard.Following the submission of cabinet paper in this regard to the Parliament, speaking to the media, State Minister of Indigenous Medicine Sisira Jayakody said: “Cannabis grown for medical purposes cannot be used for smoking. According to the agreement that we signed with the United Nations (UN), we are able to cultivate cannabis for medical and scientific purposes only, not for recreational purposes.”

Quantitatively, I think there are about 3,100 registered homestays already. Moreover, this will encourage the informal sector to come and register with the SLTDA so that they will also be able to benefit through different training programmes that are being carried out with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) across the country.” He added that the SLTDA is coming up with an online training platform that would allow interested entrepreneurs to attend sessions at their own pace and then at the end of it, sit for an examination and receive certification. Additionally, it is a matter of strengthening the segment because the demand is picking up. There will be more people occupying homestays. Therefore, the country has to maintain overall standards such as creating greater awareness of how they should interact with the foreigners, their positives and negatives, so that the community is well aware, Fernando elaborated.  According to SLTDA, the homestay concept has been in existence for a few years in Sri Lanka. Yet, if the country does not maintain the standards and performance, it can have a negative impact on the overall image of the country. Fernado noted: “ homestays will be much cheaper than hotel rooms. It's a structured accommodation sector that SLTDA will be offering. There are many different segments of tourism. There are  guest houses, boutique hotels, villas, and five - four star hotels.”The rate, in fact, does not depend on whether it is a homestay or boutique hotel. It mainly depends on what is being offered. The homestay operators can establish a price by themselves.Moreover, it is up to them to build up a demand for their homestay accommodation business. The homestay owner can decide on the marketing aspect such as how to position their product, how to market, how to use social media and web pages to promote the business.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/s2YKAzOBZiThRAlYSALI,05 Feb 2023,Issues beyond the curriculum,"While highlighting the brain drain the country is enduring at the moment, State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath recently stated that plans were underway to include tech subjects in the school curriculum to shape tech talent from a young age. Even though the plans to include more tech subjects in the school curriculum appear to be a good idea, this alone will not address the issue of brain drain being witnessed in the country’s tech sector, which is considered to be one of the most talented in South Asia. The brain drain is a result of irrational, poorly formulated, and ad hoc policy decisions taken by consecutive governments, a situation that people have now grown weary of. The new Personal Income Tax (PIT) has become a catalyst for the ongoing brain drain. In general, tech industry salaries fall within PIT limits, making tech professionals pay PIT every month amidst the ongoing economic crisis. No one would mind paying taxes if tax revenue was used efficiently to improve the livelihoods of people instead of filling the pockets of politicians. Those who blame professionals who migrate for better opportunities citing local tax rates state that Western countries impose a larger percentage of PIT. However, they fail to realise that in those countries, accountability and credibility is high, corruption is lower, and even if corruption does take place, perpetrators will be held accountable. Tax revenue is often used to improve the livelihoods of citizens in such countries, whereas in Sri Lanka, it is the livelihoods of politicians that we have been improving for decades. Even if a professional is fine with paying taxes and therefore remains in Sri Lanka, they will still have to face multiple other issues, such as shortages of basic necessities. We continue to face power cuts on a daily basis and this has almost become a part of life, a state of affairs Sri Lankans have become used to. If an individual pays their taxes, is an ethical citizen, and pays their electricity bills even at increased rates, is it not their basic right to enjoy an uninterrupted power supply? Apparently not, as we are paying the price for inefficiencies in the country’s power sector. This same scenario applies for fuel, LP Gas, medicine, raw materials, and other essential materials. Even when one is willing to compromise regarding all these shortages and deal with the quality deterioration and high interest rates, it is clear that whoever is competing to capture power at the next elections appears to have no clue on how to take the economy forward. One party said that it would not seek International Monetary Fund (IMF) support nor increase the tax rate, but was promising to steer the economy forward. Another party said that it would work with the IMF only if the two conditions it would put forward to the IMF were accepted by the fund, forgetting that it is we who need the IMF and not vice versa. The future certainly looks unpromising, with parties having no idea about fundamental economic issues or a long-term recovery plan. One cannot blame the people for deciding to leave the country amidst such a chaotic situation. These are the issues that need to be addressed along with the brain drain. Without addressing them, regardless of the school level at which the Government adds tech subjects to the curriculum, people will still choose to migrate in search of better opportunities once they complete their studies and work for a few years in Sri Lanka, leaving the local ICT sector in a vulnerable state.

But with the tax reforms, the Government looks forward to improving it to 15% of the GDP,” Semasinghe highlighted. He said government revenue has, in fact, increased in comparison to 2022, while this year, it has improved by 43%. However, Government spending has also increased by 38% during the period between January to August as a result of interest payments. He also added that the Government still could not reach a staff-level agreement with the IMF in receiving the second tranche of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Nevertheless, he said he is “confident” in achieving what is to follow further discussions with the IMF, Semasinghe added. Inland Revenue Department (IRD) of Sri Lanka Commissioner General D.R.S. Hapuarachchi said that some taxpayers in the country unnecessarily pay a huge amount merely for non-compliance with regard to tax payments rather than paying the tax on time to the Inland Revenue.Hapuarachchi further said: “However, they are not out of the woods. They only escape for a particular period as per the experiences in the IRD.”

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/vssSaPgzFe1TjIXbsB1J,22 Jan 2023 | By Dhananath Fernando,A well-told lie is worth a thousand facts,"Sri Lanka has always been consistent about two things. First, finding a villain to blame for incidents that have taken place in the past for Sri Lanka’s performance. Second, waiting for a hero to rescue us all with magical powers without making sure the systems and markets work. We always fail to evaluate reasons and economic context and understand the behaviour of people from an economic angle. A recent example is politicians claiming the economic crisis was a result of the Aragalaya and blaming the people who protested against the hardships they were going through, without realising that the economic crisis is what led to the Aragalaya.  In a new turn, fingers have now been pointed at exporters, claiming that they have not brought money back into the country and accusing them of being part of the problem. In my view, the figures mentioned in relation to claims that exporters have parked funds outside are unrealistic. Some Sri Lankan companies have scaled their operations very successfully around the world, which has been done legally. For instance, there are energy investments in Bangladesh and Senegal and manufacturing plants in Africa and neighbouring India. Even our IT sector is expanding to the Middle East and to different regions around the globe using legally owned foreign exchange. Everywhere there could be people who break the rules. That is why regulators and police are there to take action.For many years there have been accusations that importers are under-invoicing. Has that led to savings?This is obviously illegal and remedial action needs to be taken, but what is more important is to understand why it happens. We need to understand the reasons behind this and understand the reality with a solution-oriented framework. In most cases, the enemy is within, though we try to find the enemy outside. In my view, there are three main factors that influence such malpractices.Market intervention by the Central BankWhen central banks infuse more money into the system to maintain artificial interest rates, the exchange rate comes under pressure or the currency depreciates. The fear of currency collapse makes people withdraw money or avoid bringing money into the country.Not only exporters, but even Sri Lankans who were sending remittances stopped sending their money through the banking system. Instead, they sent money through unofficial means at a depreciated exchange rate. When domestic prices are rising due to money printing or import controls, their families back home naturally need more money to buy goods.However, exporters cannot keep unlimited amounts of money outside the country. Exporters need money to run their local operations, so they have to convert their export proceedings and get Sri Lankan Rupees to run the operation. When interest rates are kept artificially low, there is an incentive to borrow domestically and delay the conversion of dollars into rupees. However there is a limit to what exporters can borrow. Even if they borrow domestically, it cannot contribute to a foreign exchange shortage unless the Central Bank printed money to maintain an artificially low policy rate through discount windows or reverse repo operations.If banks give extra loans to exporters, they have to cut down on other loans (to housebuilders, for example) or they have to pay higher rates and get deposits and reduce the consumption of their customers. Banks do not have to reduce other credit if the interest rate is maintained artificially through the injection of new money.The policy of the Central Bank has simply created a highly unstable financial situation and it is human behaviour to protect one’s hard-earned money, so they will obviously keep their money outside. Understanding this should not require any financial expertise; even basic logic is enough. This is understood by our unskilled workforce contributing to our economy through remittances. To return to the matter of exporters, the margins are low in trading businesses and export quantities have to keep moving; a business cannot run without money. We have to reevaluate the numbers and it is unlikely that more than 10% of the proceedings will be repatriated, which is a figure that leans more towards the higher side. Even that is profits or value created by exporters. If the money comes, the exporter will use it and it will trigger demand. If money is not brought back, it will not become imports and instead becomes a private foreign reserve. While it may contribute to higher interest rates, this type of activity will simply reduce imports and not create forex shortages.There were claims that some exporters sent goods to Singapore or Dubai and re-sold the goods to third countries while keeping some money there. We need to understand why people try to keep money outside the country. Who wants to bring money into an unstable country? Dubai and Singapore do not have central banks that print money and people not only import and export freely, they can also freely send capital in and out.Sri Lanka, on the other hand, has exchange controls. Again, this is due to money printed to keep interest rates artificially low, which is exerting pressure on the exchange rate. Economists call this the impossible trinity of monetary policy objectives. A central bank cannot hold an exchange rate and allow the free flow of capital if it also prints money to control interest rates.Exchange controls can be seen as a tool used to delay interest rates. It is worthwhile to recall the scale of Central Bank interventions and controls during this crisis. The Central Bank places price controls on Treasury bills and printed money. Exchange controls were also tightened further instead of correcting interest rates and stopping money printing.The Treasury placed import controls on hundreds of items. The Central Bank increased margins for Letters of Credit (LCs). Moreover, forward markets for foreign exchange were killed, putting importers at risk and also damaging businesses that had hedged their imported input costs. Exporters were forced to convert their dollars early, which created problems for some exporters who had been in the habit of giving credit to customers to win business from competitors.Additionally, forced conversion rules were imposed on service receipts. Some service workers and those others who used to bring these to the country and save them in foreign exchange accounts then kept their money abroad. Unlike goods exporters, service exporters have larger margins.By this time, banks were facing a capital outflow and were unable to renew their credit lines and in some cases dollar-rupee swaps. Forced dollar conversions reduced dollar liquidity and brought these closer to default.There are also concerns as to whether it is a violation of property rights for banks to force account holders to convert dollars without their consent. Foreign exchange controls are in any case a violation of property rights.This very column previously warned of the potential drying up of forex with such market interventions. In simple terms, in a context where LKR is not hard pegged to the USD with floating interest rates or if there are no floating rates, all additional money supplied to the financial system to keep rates down evaporates in the form of imports, even with under-invoicing.Trade barriers – High and complicated tariff structure Making tariff structures complicated is an incentive for corruption. The level of corruption that takes place at customs is no secret and the more complicated the system becomes, the more room for corruption. Simply, when the cost of corruption is lower than the legal procedure, the incentives are in place for corruption. This column has on many occasions recommended a simple tariff structure with three bands so that paying import tariffs becomes easier than taking on the cost of corruption. This was proved by Prof. Premachandra Athukorala in a practical research he undertook, where bringing down the tariffs by half on selected HS codes ensured that the Government income from those particular imported items doubled. Too many restrictions and intervention are the genesis of black markets and corruption. One of the easiest ways to minimise corruption at Sri Lanka Customs is to make our tariff structure simple, low, and consistent. Poor business environment Overall, Sri Lanka’s business environment is extremely poor. We have to ask ourselves why our own people leave the country and why they are reluctant to bring their money into the country. The answer is not complicated; we may act rationally or emotionally at times, but when it comes to money, we all tend to make rational decisions, especially when there is a tangible cost or benefit associated with it. It is obvious that people consider all alternative options to protect their hard-earned money. This is one reason remittances were not sent through official channels. Family members still received the money and imports still took place, but without going through the official channels. Any imports paid for with unofficial funds – such as open account imports – reduce the demand for dollars from exports.Now that the Central Bank has raised rates and reduced money printing, leading to reduced exchange rates, people are sending their money through official channels. This shows that most people prefer to send their money through official and legal channels if a stable and consistent system is available.It has been a while since Standard and Poor’s, Fitch Ratings, and many other international agencies warned about Sri Lanka’s worsening economic crisis. As such, our economic environment was extremely poor, which was why people did not feel that it was safe to bring their money into the country. The same happened even in Africa – with the crisis in Zimbabwe, many had bank accounts in Cape Town to protect the value of their money. Final thoughts One has to be careful about harassing exporters. Exporters, especially subsidiaries of foreign countries, have other countries to operate in. Under-invoicing exports is wrong, as it will reduce profits within the country. This is a tax fraud. However, reducing profits cannot contribute to forex shortages since any money that is not spent in the country will also reduce imports.Sri Lanka wishes to be a hub for South Asia. It wishes to become a place where companies set up regional headquarters. If currency instability and exchange controls exist, these will not be set up in this country. Moreover, there are also rules on transfer pricing. If Sri Lanka possessed monetary stability, if there were no exchange controls, and if its tax rates were reasonable – the US has been pushing for a global corporate tax rate of 15% – companies would not try to take profits to safer places.Exporters and importers have been harassed over the years. Framing exporters as the reason for the crisis instead of solving our own problems will simply make the situation worse. Can we really put the entire weight of the economic crisis on our exporters, forgetting the bond scam, Easter attacks, droughts, Covid-19, borrowing money at very high interest in USD, and investing in unproductive projects? The enemy is within, but we are always looking for a culprit outside. In politics, sometimes a well-told lie is worth a thousand facts.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/xr0ufqG0iHWqQes8d99j,05 May 2024 | By Shenal Fernando,Excise Dept. reports 26% revenue increase amid production decline,"Increase in excise tariffs contributes to decreased demand for excise articlesDept. meets 98% of revenue target for first four months of 2024Tough stance against beedi manufacturers failing to comply with tax The Excise Department has recorded a 26% Year-on-Year (YoY) revenue increase in comparison to the equivalent period in 2023 despite low production volumes. Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, Commissioner General of Excise M.J. Gunasiri stated that despite the decrease in demand for excise articles, the department had successfully recorded a 26% YoY increase in excise duties collected during the first four months of this year in comparison to the corresponding period in 2023. He attributed this to the increase in excise tariffs and the tax administration efforts of the department. Gunasiri revealed that the sharp increase in excise tariffs over the past two years, with a 15% increase in prices in 2024 itself, had adversely impacted the demand for excise articles. As a result, the production volumes of all excise articles continue to trail behind the volumes recorded in 2022.“We still haven’t reached the production volumes of 2022. However, the price increase and our actions have allowed us to achieve a 26% YoY revenue increase in the first four months of 2024 when compared to 2023,” he stated. He noted that when comparing the revenue earned by the Excise Department during the first four months of 2024 to targets set at the beginning of this year, the department had met 98% of its revenue target.  He further stated that the department was adopting a hard stance against beedi manufacturers regarding their compliance with excise tax liabilities. Moreover, he noted that they had informed all beedi manufacturers that the department’s registration for such manufacturers would be revoked in the event they failed to pay their taxes in a timely manner.“We will cancel their registration if they don’t pay taxes. If you are not paying taxes, it means you are not manufacturing beedi, so the licence of anyone who isn’t manufacturing will be revoked,” he stated.Gunasiri further revealed that the Excise Department had commenced issuing transport licences for beedi manufacturers from 1 May, provided that the tax on beedi was paid, considering various issues they had faced with law enforcement whilst transporting products.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/kQIAuXPgV50NEoHv06lT,15 Jan 2024,Nearly 20% drop in cement consumption in 2023,"Sri Lanka’s cement market continued to lose momentum with a 17% decline recorded in 2023, with its construction industry facing the toughest periods in its history due to the negative effects of the economic downturn. The sharp reduction of construction activities since the start of 2023 has pushed the industry into near collapse, a fate the key industry players think is made more inevitable with the anticipated exponential rise of operational costs, following the introduction of VAT in January 2024.Despite the forecasted growth in demand, Sri Lanka's cement industry not only fell short but contracted even more rapidly than expected in the face of the post-pandemic economic decline. Apart from the 16% increase in 2021 which came from import restrictions due to wider forex illiquidity, cement consumption has continuously moved on a downward trajectory since 2017. It is anticipated that on the heels of a substantial 36% negative growth in 2022, compounding the industry stagnation as the country struggles to rebound from the ensuing financial crisis.With the onset of the pandemic-related economic slowdown the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of cement, which remained stable for a long time, was revised frequently, with fluctuations taking place in 2022. However, as the economy started showing signs of relative stability in 2023, cement manufacturers promptly passed on the cost benefit to the consumers as and when they occurred.MRP Revisions of Manufactured Cement from 2022 to 2024In this backdrop, the market shrinkage further intensified as the disposable income of consumers got restricted with the increment of income taxes and sharp increases in utility prices. Furthermore, the almost doubling of contractor fees and labour costs discouraged construction activities in the residential sector. Optimism of a more stable cost environment for businesses as the Rupee stabilised against the US Dollar was short lived, due to several tax increases. In addition to an increase in corporate taxes, a CESS was imposed on the importation of raw materials. The escalation of costs is further intensified by the high lending rates, which caused most construction projects to halt ongoing work whilst others postponed the commencement of new projects in both residential and commercial sectors.In this backdrop, the VAT percentage increase coupled with the expansion of the VAT liable goods and services list will raise fuel and transport costs, to further increase the cost of operations for manufacturers. This sharp increase negates any price benefits that were passed on to the consumers previously. This situation severely threatens business continuity of local cement manufacturers who are struggling to survive whilst being unable to recover extensive investments on business development. Over the past several years, cement manufacturers have invested heavily in capacity expansion to meet the expected growth in consumer demand.An unfavourable market impacts all players in the industry. When the permeation of revenue and profits generated by local manufacturers through their vast value chains gets restricted in a contracting market, the overall economic recovery of the country is bound to slow down. Whilst some of these decisions are required to overcome the current economic crisis, it is imperative that the policy decisions are made in consideration of the long-term and overall impact on all the players of the national economy.

Rathnayake stated that the Department of Management Services had been instructed to carry out an assessment of employment within the public sector and to identify opportunities for resolving the prevailing challenge of surplus State workers. The assessment is expected to make recommendations on how productivity can be achieved with a reduced workforce. Elaborating further, Rathnayake revealed that Voluntary Retirement Scheme options were being discussed with regard to certain selected State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) such as the State Engineering Corporation (SEC).He added: “No discussions have been held so far with regard to retirement packages for Government services. However, we have taken some other measures. The Government has imposed a freeze on all recruitment unless there is an essential technical requirement and all other recruitments have been put on hold. Despite the annual retirements, State agencies have been advised to manage with their existing human resource base.”Approximately 19.1% of the overall workforce in Sri Lanka constitutes public sector employees, which has been highlighted as a significant burden on State coffers during the ongoing economic crisis. It is well documented that the issues relating to the surplus of State workers are due to certain politicians having utilised the public service as a means to reward political associates with employment. Furthermore, some politicians have seen the recruitment of public service employees as an additional avenue for generating income. Hence, the Government has made multiple public declarations about its plan to decrease the size of the public sector workforce in the future. As a part of this effort, on 13 June 2022, the Government approved five-year unpaid leave for employees in the public sector, allowing them to work abroad without experiencing any loss in terms of their seniority or pension entitlements.

We will provide a sector forecast along with necessary statistics and data, including the number of five-star hotel rooms and four-star hotel rooms that would be needed by that time. We will give you statistics to decide where to invest,” he added.  According to him, businesses are afraid to expand or undertake new investments due to a lack of assurance and guidance from the Government and pointed at the economic slowdown that is created by the people weeks prior to the announcement of a Budget. “Investors stop investing two months prior to announcing a budget. People stop buying and selling vehicles. Economic activities stop, slowing down the whole economy, because people do not know what is coming,” Dissanayake stated. In his speech, he also covered introducing a fund to safeguard the struggling small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the rural community.According to him, the NPP’s national economic policy revolves around increasing services and goods manufacturing, allowing the underprivileged in the rural areas to be a part of this process, and ensuring wealth distribution even to the lowest 10% of the population.

Therefore, we have carried out an in-depth investigation into how the rapid development of the country has been prevented by the overlapping, ad hoc laws and regulations which have been introduced,” he stated. Withanage further pointed out that these ad hoc laws and regulations had created an uneven playing field for e-commerce companies, with foreign e-commerce companies enjoying greater leniency in terms of taxes when compared to their local counterparts.He also observed that while incorporated companies were registered with the Registrar of Companies, sole proprietorships and partnerships were registered at the Divisional Secretariat level. Moreover, Local Government institutions such as Municipal Councils and Urban Councils also issue permits for certain businesses. As a result, the country lacks a proper database on the total number of incorporated companies, sole proprietorships, and partnerships in existence.

Therefore, he pointed out that the development of travel apps to cater to the Sri Lankan market represented an attractive business opportunity. However, he noted that the SLTDA’s role in such app development would be limited to that of a regulator.“There are three travel apps currently being developed. The SLTDA has specified the required criteria and guidelines to register anyone who comes up with a travel app. However, the development of the apps will be done entirely by the private sector. “If they conform to our guidelines and criteria, we will register them. They will be privy to the information of the other service providers in the industry, with whom they can work together. We will share all information of established organisations in the hospitality sector, Destination Management Companies (DMCs), recreational services providers, and whoever is registered with the SLTDA. “All information relating to places of interest, cultural sites, beaches, and wildlife parks will be carried on these apps, so it will be very easy for tourists to decide. The details of all guides will be available there. If a tourist wants a Spanish-speaking guide, they can get in touch with such a guide through these apps,” he stated.Fernando further revealed that the SLTDA was actively pushing the respective private sector entities to launch their travel apps and that all three apps were expected to be operational within six months.He revealed that these travel apps would also allow tourists to contact registered transport providers, which would assist the SLTDA in identifying the transport provider, thereby addressing any safety concerns for tourists. Accordingly, he pointed out that the use of such travel apps would facilitate achieving better control over the tourist experience.Previously in 2020, the SLTDA announced plans to launch an all-inclusive Sri Lanka Tourism app developed with funding from the UNDP. However, Fernando clarified that this app would not be an all-inclusive app and would merely be an information app, adding that it would also be launched in the near future.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/HUXCymPPMzxx9Y9fyShn,25 Jun 2023 | By Roshani Fernando,Ceramics industry suffers adverse effects,"Challenges prompt share sell-offs Sri Lanka’s ceramics industry, comprising 11 prominent ceramic companies, is grappling with multiple challenges that have significantly impacted its operations and financial performance, The Sunday Morning Business learns. The industry is currently facing hurdles such as the implementation of new PAYE taxes, soaring energy costs, escalating labour expenses, and the rising costs of importing raw materials. Consequently, affected companies are being compelled to sell off a substantial portion of their stock to mitigate the mounting pressures, according to highly-placed industry sources. Export Development Board (EDB) Chairman Dr. Kingsley Bernard expressed concerns over the situation, stating that the ceramics sector operated continuously with intricate technical involvement. He emphasised the need for highly-skilled engineers and managers who could dedicate themselves to the business process. “The imposition of new PAYE taxes has severely eroded the industry’s net income, forcing companies to seek alternative revenue streams. Consequently, employee commitment has diminished significantly, resulting in a notable decline in production efficiency.”A major blow to the ceramics industry stems from the exponential rise in energy costs. Manufacturers of ceramic and porcelain goods have seen production costs surge by approximately 75-80% between January 2022 and June 2022 due to escalating expenses associated with energy consumption.Importing raw materials has also become more costly for the industry. Despite the potential global competitiveness offered by the appreciation of the US Dollar against the Sri Lankan Rupee, the expense of importing necessary inputs has risen. Dr. Bernard added that the value of the USD had increased by approximately 45% between January 2022 and June 2022, exacerbating the cost burden for ceramic companies. The combination of increased energy costs, labour expenses, and import expenditures has significantly impacted the industry’s profitability.Due to the escalating costs of energy and production, some significant Sri Lankan porcelain companies are resorting to selling shares to maintain competitiveness in the global market. The economic crisis in Sri Lanka has also contributed to declining local demand, intensifying the struggles faced by businesses on both domestic and international fronts.Moreover, the ceramics industry faces another setback resulting from the suspension of construction activities due to the economic downturn. Consequently, the demand for ceramic and porcelain products in the local market – including wall and floor tiles, tableware, kitchenware, and sanitary ware – has experienced a noticeable decline.The primary ceramic exports from Sri Lanka consist of tableware and kitchenware, wall tiles, other ceramic products, ornaments, and sanitary ware. The contribution of these exports to Sri Lanka’s total export revenue in 2022 was approximately 0.3%. Notably, this foreign income was generated by the operations of 11 ceramic companies, which have played a crucial role in bolstering the country’s economy amid the ongoing dollar crisis.According to the International Trade Centre (ITC) Trade Map statistics, the global demand for ceramic products reached $ 58.3 billion in 2021 and climbed to $ 64.4 billion in 2022, marking a growth rate of around 10% compared to the previous year. Despite this growth, the rate of expansion declined by 17% when compared to the years 2020 and 2021, suggesting a diminishing global market demand. This trend can be attributed, at least in part, to the global recession triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.The EDB’s statistics on export figures for the period from January to April show a fluctuating trend. In 2018, ceramic exports amounted to $ 9.33 million, followed by $ 9.20 million in 2019, a drop to $ 6.44 million in 2020, a recovery to $ 11.31 million in 2021, a slight decline to $ 10.88 million in 2022, and finally a decrease to $ 10.51 million in 2023.The major markets for Sri Lanka’s diverse ceramic products are as follows: tableware and kitchenware find consumers in India, the US, Japan, China, the UAE, Sweden, Germany; wall and floor tiles are exported to Australia, the US, the Maldives, Oman, and India; ornaments are popular in Denmark, the US, the UK, Japan, Italy, Australia, and South Korea; while red clay roof tiles are primarily shipped to the UK and the UAE. The high quality achieved through the combination of advanced technology and traditional indigenous craftsmanship has positioned Sri Lankan ceramic products in renowned department stores worldwide, such as Macy’s, Crate & Barrel, Marks & Spencer, Hallmark, Pottery Barn, El Corte Inglés, Debenhams, Susie Watson Designs, John Lewis, House of Fraser, Sanrio, and Isetan. Additionally, Sri Lanka manufactures products under prestigious licences, including Walt Disney, Universal Studios, Lucas Arts, and Warner Brothers. All Sri Lankan tableware products adhere to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) norms and ASTM standards.The production of high-quality ceramic products necessitates non-clay minerals such as feldspar, silica sand, quartz, calcite, and dolomite. While supplies for these raw materials are available, Government regulations present challenges in obtaining certain materials like tanks and slit. Additionally, ceramic and porcelain manufacturers must rely on imported raw materials, further complicating their production processes.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/5wV8Sm6uStpvGdlwkVfG,16 Apr 2023 | By Tanya Shan,Dreaming of a green economy,"Can Sri Lanka become Asia’s first green economy? President Ranil Wickremesinghe recently announced plans to introduce a green economic policy for Sri Lanka within the next two months.He stated that the island nation would become the first country in the region to adopt a green economy, with the Ministries of Environment and Power and Energy and the Climate Change Office working together to introduce a green economic policy focused on renewable energy.The President announced this during a meeting with investors who attended the Sri Lanka Green Energy Summit, which took place at the President’s Office on 27 March.President Wickremesinghe also expressed commitment to facilitating both local and foreign investors, adding that the green economic policy due to be implemented soon would be the first of its kind in the region.“Sri Lanka is currently facing two major challenges – debt restructuring and transitioning to green energy. While debt restructuring is already underway, the country must also act quickly to establish a green economy. Sri Lanka has great potential to generate energy through renewable sources such as solar, wind, biogas, and sea waves. President Wickremesinghe believes that transitioning to a green economy could be the key to building a stronger economy for Sri Lanka,” the President’s Media Division (PMD) stated.The President highlighted that Sri Lanka had the potential to become the first in Asia in green energy, thanks to its natural resources and the experienced investors present at the meeting. He also mentioned the ongoing discussion of bringing an oil pipeline from India to Trincomalee and emphasised the importance of cooperation with South India in moving towards renewable energy.Short-term difficulties However, can Sri Lanka really become the first country in Asia to adopt green energy? The Sunday Morning Business posed this question to several local economists. Rajarata University of Sri Lanka Department of Economics Prof. R.P.I.R. Prasanna told The Sunday Morning Business that in 2020, the Government had initiated similar policies to promote a green economy by banning fertilisers. He stated as a party to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Sri Lanka would have to adhere to said goals to promote green concepts. SDGs were born at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro in 2012.“Countries are already following these concepts. We will have an advantage if we can promote green concepts. In the short term, implementation will be very hard. We need a change in the system and also in the attitudes of the people,” he noted. Prasanna further noted that since Sri Lanka was in a crisis situation, it would take at least three or four years for it to emerge from the crisis, which meant that growth would only commence afterwards.  He said that Sri Lanka would have to follow the concepts of a green economy despite the short-term difficulties. Moreover, he added that the green economy was a global trend and that people were more conscious of the environment when making decisions at present. “The President’s attempts should be appreciated. We need to have a clear path to achieve those targets and green concepts. The Government is looking at this problem as if we are also a developed country, but we should consider this from the point of view of a developing country and implement it,” Prasanna opined. Green economy not the priority Meanwhile, University of Peradeniya Department of Economics and Statistics Prof. Wasantha Athukorala stated that he did not believe that the Government had sufficient resources for this, adding that with the prevailing poverty levels and other macroeconomic issues, working towards a green economy was not a priority for citizens.He added that the focus of the people was mostly on making a living, planning their next meal, and battling through the present crisis, noting that people had a great deal of other issues to prioritise.“In economics, there are theories that explain income and demand. When income levels are higher, the demand for a green economy too will increase. However, with lower incomes and high commodity prices, people can only afford to worry about themselves. Caring about the environment has become a luxury. People do not have the luxury to care about what is good or bad for the environment,” he opined. Pointing out the abrupt fertiliser ban the Government imposed a few years ago, Athukorala stated that although this policy had a huge demand globally, it had proved to be a failure in Sri Lanka and had also damaged the local agricultural sector. “There are countries with little to no trees and only skyscrapers and buildings. How are they getting oxygen? They must be getting oxygen from countries such as ours with trees. There should be payment mechanisms to protect this greenery. Countries that make an effort to preserve their greenery should have some incentive to maintain them.” He emphasised that people should be educated on the green economy. A green economy is defined as one which is low carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive. In a green economy, growth in employment and income is driven by public and private investment into such economic activities, infrastructure and assets that allow reduced carbon emissions and pollution, enhanced energy and resource efficiency, and prevention of the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/MzO3R2S4BrFXs1e95MRd,29 Jan 2023 | By Senaka Alawattegama,Upholding the spirit of privatisation to unlock the potential of RPCs,"Despite the remarkable resilience of our people, industries, and enterprises, Sri Lanka’s economic outlook in 2023 – along with approximately one-third of all countries according to the IMF – appears bleak. Worse yet is the fact that this economic fall from grace was predicted for many years, even prior to the onset of the Covid pandemic. The fact that Sri Lanka’s policymakers chose to do nothing to avoid economic catastrophe despite being clearly, forcefully, and repeatedly warned about this inevitable outcome has been a source of shock to many. But to those in the plantation industry who have been grappling with systematic ineptitude from policymakers for decades, their consistency in making the wrong decisions is an all too familiar pattern that only helps to illustrate the root cause of these issues, namely, the absence of credible and informed stakeholder consultation in policymaking. One of the best examples of this dynamic has been the disastrous decision to convert Sri Lanka into 100% organic agriculture overnight. Implemented with zero consultation or consideration of the interests of the industry and its stakeholders, almost every expert agrees that this decision was the proverbial straw that broke this nation’s back.   Nearly 500 million missed opportunitiesFrom the time it was first announced, the plantation and agriculture sector, including tea smallholders and Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) alike were unanimous in their opposition and scientific criticism of this policy. Yet instead of taking these accurate perspectives into account, logic was discarded in favour of agri policy derived from election podiums, leading to a total ban on the importation of all synthetic agri-chemicals. Based on the performance of Sri Lankan tea alone, we now have a minimum dollar value to illustrate the size of that mistake. Today the Sri Lankan tea industry has set a target of $ 1.5 billion in precious export revenue. A shortage in supply of quality greenleaf means that Sri Lankan tea has also benefited from some of the highest dollar prices on tea exports since 2017. Coincidentally, Sri Lanka’s export earnings from tea at that time stood at approximately $ 1.5 billion, meaning that our current target is simply to do as well as we did in 2017.However, despite having regained the same favourable prices that we enjoyed in 2017, in 2022, our nation was only able to produce approximately 250 million kg of tea, whereas in 2017, we had produced 307 million kg. The result is that we only generated just under $ 1.1 billion in tea exports last year, compared to $ 1.5 billion in 2017. The shortfall was worth approximately $ 466 million – funds that could have been utilised for the purchase of fuel, gas, medicines, and other essential items. Given the rapidly deteriorating global economic climate that we all face in 2023, all Sri Lankans must now appreciate that as a nation, we have no margin of error left. In that spirit, on behalf of all RPCs, we wish to once again reiterate our industry’s core policy priorities over the coming year.Wage reform towards productivity linked earnings The debate surrounding wages has been a longstanding one and has once again come under the spotlight with the increase in the cost of living. Two years ago, our industry was compelled for the first time since 1992 to enter into litigation as a result of the ill-advised decision on the part of trade unions to abandon the terms of the collective bargaining agreement by involving the Wages Board to pay a daily wage of Rs. 1,000 per day. Despite challenges faced within the industry, we must reiterate that we have been able to honour our commitment even at present to pay the said amount amidst certain factions having falsely accused RPCs of not doing so.  While certain parties demand limiting the pay to Rs. 1,000, the Planters’ Association of Ceylon (PA) has time and again advocated for a model that will allow a worker to earn beyond this. We believe it is long past time to move away from the archaic colonial era daily wage model and into a system that will incentivise workers based on performance. A productivity linked wage model has seen a positive impact on many estates and has proven its effectiveness among tea smallholders who contribute to 70% of the tea production in the country.Typically on estates where it has been tested, harvesters have, on average, increased their output from 18 kg to 24 kg and have earned over Rs. 65,000. While some trade unions and other groups continue to offer knee-jerk opposition to these reforms, workers with actual first-hand experience with the productivity linked wages are overwhelmingly in support of them. This is because, on average, they have the potential to increase their earnings by 80-100% relative to the current fixed daily wage of Rs. 1,000 that was forced on the sector through the Wages Board. Moreover, productivity linked wages offer flexibility to harvesters in the time spent on the fields and are incentivised based solely on performance and output. We believe this could also provide a solution to the shortage of labour experienced in the industry at present. For the RPC sector, our workforce has reduced from 300,000 to approximately 100,000 to date, and shows no signs of stopping. Especially if Sri Lanka is to achieve its national production targets, our first priority is to implement every viable measure to reverse the migration of labour out of the plantation sector.Land use policies and diversification: Our way forwardWhile tea and rubber have put Sri Lanka on the map, we believe it is an opportune time for Sri Lanka’s plantation sector to diversify its product offerings to the world. It is absolutely critical for Sri Lanka to harness its resources and assets in the most optimum level possible. However, to do this, RPCs need to be given a free hand to determine their own land use policies which would be beneficial for the economy. In instances where the land has become unsuitable for crops like tea or rubber, plantations should be looking to instead produce other valuable crops like coffee and spices which most of our RPCs have been successful in doing. However, there is more that can be done. Companies are already experimenting with crops like avocado and berries which have yielded successful results and valuable new export opportunities.In that regard, another crop with strong export earning potential is palm oil. We cannot overlook the economic benefits this golden crop could offer Sri Lanka, especially at a time when the country requires dollars to purchase essentials like fuel, medicines, and gas. At present, Sri Lanka produces approximately 25,000 MT, whereas it imports 200,000 MT of palm oil for domestic usage. The value of those imports is now over Rs. 24 billion.Like the 100% organic strategy before it, the campaign against oil palm cultivation has long been proven to be completely lacking scientific facts and the PA has since the beginning provided evidence as to how this crop can be grown in an ethical and sustainable manner without causing harm to the environment. Diversification is not merely a revenue growth strategy – it is a de-risking strategy, which ensures that even when one industry experiences a downturn, others may be able to continue, ensuring the financial viability of the whole. However, to do this successfully, RPCs require support from the Government by enabling and providing the necessary assistance to grow crops that are financially viable and freedom to utilise the land in the best possible way. Crisis as an opportunity for greater collaborationSince the privatisation of the plantation sector in 1992, RPCs have come a long way, with the past two years being incredibly challenging for all. This has pushed the sector to become innovative and use technology to unlock new potentials in the industry – an example of this is the online auction system which was implemented during a short period of time.RPCs have also been experimenting with precision agriculture in order to optimise plant nutrition and effective utilisation of agri-chemicals following the ban with some even going into producing their own fertiliser to cut down on cost and to be able to meet their requirement.These promising advancements are a testament to the plantation sector’s ability to adapt and find innovative methods amidst a crisis. However, if we are to unlock the full potential of this billion dollar industry, it is imperative that we learn from the mistakes of the past and work together to prevent any further repetitions of the kind of policies that got us to this point. Privatisation in its true form is therefore the only way forward – to allow businesses to do business, while the Government stays focused on policy that is led by individuals who understand and are focused on commercial realities. It is safe to say that the spirit of privatisation is the spirit of democracy where collaboration is essential to securing the best outcome for all.(The writer is the Chairman of the Planters’ Association of Ceylon)

(AASL) reveals.Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, AASL Chairman Maj. Gen. (Retd) G.A. Chandrasiri stated that the Government had informed that the funding from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) related to the BIA Terminal II project would be released within the next couple of months. Therefore, the AASL was currently preparing to recommence construction work at the BIA, he stated.The contract for the construction of the BIA Terminal II project valued at $ 564 million was awarded to the Taisei Corporation in 2020.According to the terms of the JICA funding, the contractor must be Japanese. However, following the stoppage of construction work last year due to the funding freeze imposed by JICA in the wake of Sri Lanka’s default, Taisei Corporation terminated its contract with Sri Lanka.Chandrasiri stated: “I’m not aware who the new contractor will be. That is a decision that will be made at the national level by the Sri Lankan Government and JICA. AASL is only the company that is in charge of the operation aspect of this project. The technicalities of the funding will be determined at the national level.” The construction of this multi-level terminal is part of Package A of the BIA expansion project which is estimated to cost Rs. 133 billion and will be largely funded by the Special Term for Economic Partnership (STEP) concessionary Official Development Assistance (ODA) loan granted by JICA amounting to Rs. 131.5 billion (¥ 74.4 billion) at a 0.1% interest rate per annum. The remaining Rs. 21.5 billion is being funded by the AASL.With regard to Package A, the AASL entered into two agreements with JICA – the first agreement was entered into in March 2012 for ¥ 29 billion and the second agreement was entered into in March 2016 for ¥ 45.4 billion.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/IoZRqcKyEk5cvHiau96B,11 Jun 2023 | By Tanya Shan,Growth hindered by connectivity challenges?,"Sri Lanka wishes to attract more Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), rise in the Ease of Doing Business Index rankings, improve its local ICT sector, and increase service exports. Although it has many plans, Sri Lanka faces substantial challenges in terms of internet connectivity and basic infrastructure, which have the potential to impede its progress. Sri Lanka has recognised the importance of FDIs in driving economic growth and fostering technological advancements. The country’s ICT sector holds immense potential as a catalyst for economic development and employment generation. Despite the progress made in attracting FDIs and developing the ICT sector, Sri Lanka grapples with significant challenges in internet connectivity and basic infrastructure. Reliable and high-speed internet is vital for economic success in today’s interconnected world. However, Sri Lanka’s current connectivity falls below global standards.Data from Ookla, a renowned global speed test provider, reveals that Sri Lanka’s fixed broadband and mobile internet speeds rank below the global average. This discrepancy hampers business operations and undermines Sri Lanka’s ambition to become a thriving hub for investment and technological advancement.Insufficient infrastructure investment exacerbates connectivity issues. Limited coverage in rural areas and inadequate network infrastructure hinder inclusive growth and exacerbate disparities. Without reliable and robust connectivity, businesses, entrepreneurs, and professionals face hurdles in harnessing the full potential of digital technologies.Connectivity for business hubs a priority Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, LIRNEasia Founding Chair Professor Rohan Samarajiva highlighted the importance of distinguishing between connectivity in business locations and individual users’ connectivity.When discussing ICT investments and export-oriented industries, the focus should be on the safety and reliability of key locations such as Orion Park, the World Trade Center, and Havelock City, he noted. Prof. Samarajiva highlighted the need to ensure connectivity in these business hubs, rather than solely focusing on the connectivity experienced by individuals.Regarding investment considerations, he stressed the significance of robust connectivity in business parks. He questioned the quality of connectivity in places such as Trace City and Orion City while noting that Sri Lanka possessed sufficient international cable bandwidth. He emphasised: “In terms of investment, you need to make sure that the people in the business locations have adequate high-quality connectivity. I believe the basic infrastructure in terms of international cables is present.”He pointed out that connectivity issues faced by individual consumers were often attributed to the lack of investment and attention to quality by local data providers in the consumer segment, emphasising that these factors were not necessarily interconnected.Although improvements in overall connectivity would benefit everyone, Prof. Samarajiva reiterated the primary importance of ensuring high-quality connectivity in business locations. He expressed confidence in the existing basic infrastructure, including international cables, within Sri Lanka.Regarding the laying of fibre optic cables, he mentioned past court cases related to whether entities other than Sri Lanka Telecom could undertake such activities. To ensure reliable connectivity, he recommended the establishment of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between businesses and service providers. These agreements would include penalties for downtime and a drop in quality, thereby ensuring adequate support and service provision.He emphasised that companies were liable to make mistakes, such as insufficient investment and underestimating the impact of remote work, resulting in decreased quality. However, Prof. Samarajiva expressed optimism that once import restrictions were lifted, companies would rectify these issues and improve the overall connectivity situation.He also emphasised the need to differentiate between business and consumer segments when addressing connectivity issues. Measures for improvementSpeaking to The Sunday Morning Business, Cyber Security Analyst Asela Waidyalankara shed light on the current state of connectivity and proposed measures for improvement.Responding to an inquiry regarding Sri Lanka’s low or poor connectivity, Waidyalankara acknowledged occasional issues in terms of slow internet connections. However, he pointed out that Sri Lanka held a respectable position in the overall rankings.“While there may be quality of service issues with broadband, particularly in urban areas due to congestion caused by heavy user demand, Sri Lanka generally receives favourable recognition for its broadband connectivity according to the International Telecommunication Union rankings,” Waidyalankara stated.Highlighting the strength of Sri Lanka’s connectivity, he emphasised that it played a vital role in attracting FDI. When considering the combined coverage and 4G connectivity of all operators, the country boasts a decent infrastructure. Waidyalankara also compared Sri Lanka’s connectivity with that of other countries in the region, such as Nepal and India, citing the challenges they faced due to mountainous terrain and vast geographical size.Regarding the improvement of the ICT sector, Waidyalankara identified the need to address the skill gap and expand capacity. He expressed concerns about the migration of skilled employees, leaving a void in the industry. The analyst emphasised the necessity of producing a greater number of graduates with ICT expertise to fulfil the country’s vision of becoming an IT hub.“We need to double or maybe triple our output of graduates collectively from the State and private sectors. This is the gap we are facing, especially when compared to countries like India,” Waidyalankara observed.To address the shortage of skilled workers, he advocated for the liberalisation of the sector to attract more local students to ICT education. Additionally, he stressed the importance of making Sri Lanka an appealing destination for students from the region by offering accessible degrees and employment opportunities.Waidyalankara acknowledged the existence of certain connectivity issues in Sri Lanka but emphasised that the country’s overall connectivity was a strength that contributed to its attractiveness for investment. He urged that the focus be directed to addressing the skill gap and increasing the number of graduates to strengthen the ICT sector and position Sri Lanka as a competitive player in the global market. While State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath was not available for comment, a spokesperson from the ministry who spoke to The Sunday Morning Business said: “The Ministry of Technology recognises the importance of improving internet connectivity in Sri Lanka in order to support economic growth and development and the ministry has several comprehensive plans in this regard.” The spokesperson also stated that the ministry was actively working on expanding and upgrading the country’s telecommunications infrastructure, including broadband networks and fibre optic cables. This includes extending coverage to underserved areas and implementing advanced technologies to enhance network capacity and reliability. The spokesperson added that enhancing internet connectivity went hand in hand with promoting digital literacy and skill development among the population.While Sri Lanka’s progress in attracting FDI, improving the ease of doing business, and enhancing the ICT sector is commendable, the country’s connectivity issues pose significant hurdles. By acknowledging the challenges objectively and implementing strategic measures, Sri Lanka can address these concerns head-on. It is imperative to prioritise infrastructure development, expand coverage, and enhance connectivity to unlock the nation’s true potential as a global investment destination and ICT leader. Through collaborative efforts and continued commitment, Sri Lanka can navigate the path toward economic prosperity and technological advancement.

These changes are for investors who hold a stake in the security. Given that mutual consent is usually required for such critical changes, the consent solicitation is usually a request for permission to make a change on behalf of the stakeholder.“The deferral of the interest payments covered by this consent solicitation has been requested to provide SriLankan Airlines and the authorities sufficient time to develop a reorganisation plan and a long-term strategy for the company, and to hold discussions with the company’s stakeholders,” according to the statement by the Ministry of Finance. In addition to the deferment of two coupon payments, and a 12-month waiver on defaults, according to International Financing Review, a third request was also made to allow a revision in the bond agreement to allow investors holding not less than 50% of the total principal bond amount to instruct the bond trustee to rescind and annul any notice given to the issuer to accelerate the bonds following an event of default.“Investors who consent to all these three proposals will receive a full consent fee of 0.15% of the principal amount, while those who consent to the first two proposals but not the third will receive a partial fee of 0.125%,” International Financing Review noted. SriLankan Airlines’ Annual Report for 2020/2021 stated that the group recorded a loss of Rs. 49.7 billion.

He noted that the preceding week had seen a bullish run on LOLC Group counters, largely due to market speculation.Responding to a query on foreign interest in the market, he revealed that the preceding week had seen net foreign selling as most foreigners had sought to exit their positions amidst improved market turnover.During the preceding week, the benchmark All Share Price Index (ASPI) gained 300 basis points, crossing the 11,000 points mark for the first time since 8 October 2023. Similarly, the blue chip Standard & Poor’s Sri Lanka 20 (S&P SL20) index also gained over 110 basis points during the week.Major developments in the market during the preceding week include the corporate disclosure by Ceylon Land & Equity PLC (formally known as Shaw Wallace Investments PLC) that it had raised Rs. 1.1 billion by allotting 121,148.276 new shares. Furthermore, the shares of Arpico Insurance PLC were transferred to the Watch List on 7 March due to the non-submission of the Interim Financial Statement as at 31 December 2023.

https://www.themorning.lk/articles/srewWRpFW8WaRVfa5tZh,21 Sep 2023 | BY Roshani Fernando,Digitalisation is a journey of trial and error,"In conversation with Dialog Axiata PLC Group Chief Enterprise Officer Navin PierisThere is a revolutionary leap in the digital transformation of the country’s enterprise sector. Dialog is structured into serving digital solutions from large enterprises to the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) where their demands and solutions are very different to the rest of the country. While being a part of the Axiata group enterprise, Dialog has access to different solutions that can bring those best practices to their customers – from the Axiata group’s experience to their vendors and partners. Digital transformation has become a must since a digitalised enterprise can be faster, cheaper, and be able to scale up. In conversation with The Daily Morning Business, the company’s Group Chief Enterprise Officer Navin Pieris highlights how digitalisation has become a must for enterprises to be competitive in the market. Following are the excerpts from the interview : How is Dialog Enterprise helping to bridge the digital divide in the enterprise sector of the country?For over 25 years, Dialog has been instrumental in bridging the digital divide in the enterprise sector of the country. Our vision is to be the undisputed leader in the provision of multi-sensory connectivity, always resulting in empowerment of Sri Lankan lives and enterprises. Our vision statement not only addresses the individuals but also talks about enterprises. Then, if you look at what we are known for, we are known for the future today, because we've brought new technologies and always kept the country ahead when it comes to technology.Even when you look at connectivity, look at 3G, 4G, now coming on to 5G, Sri Lanka has been either the first in the region, or even the first in the world in certain areas. When it comes to Dialog Enterprise, we basically look at how we can be the digital partner in order to take an enterprise to the future today. In order to achieve this, we have a portfolio of solutions. Digitalisation, I would say, is not the same for everybody. It depends on the industry they are in, the size of their company, and so on; the requirements of digitalisation change. Therefore, we  have different sets of solutions to meet all those requirements, depending on the industry or their size. Our structure is there to cater to these different businesses.Together with that, we are capable of bringing these solutions to our customers.What are the key trends in the ICT industry that are driving digital transformation in Sri Lanka?If we look closer at what's happening in the macro sense, pre-COVID, a lot of digitalisation did happen. But I think it's really the pandemic that really drove a lot of us to quickly adopt digitalisation. With the lockdown, we all struggled as individuals, wondering how we might get our next meal when stored goods had finished and our movements restricted. Then, there was a lot of quick innovation and digitalisation around delivering food, and so on. Much of the delivery industry grew at the time. Supermarkets adapted to take online orders.With the outbreak of the pandemic, online ordering and purchasing became the main channel. It didn’t stop with food. It further expanded to online entertainment programmes, since there was a lockdown and people were centred at home. Moreover, the other area that changed quickly was the ability to pay online. Again, the steps to do so had already been put in place, yet not many were using it. But with COVID-19, people had no choice. Therefore, the payment infrastructure came in. I believe one of the positive sides of COVID-19 is that this process of digitalisation was accelerated. From a technology perspective, megabytes per second is what we talk about now, and that kind of bandwidth is available and affordable. Without that technology, you don't have the lifeblood to connect all your IT businesses and so on together. Then with the innovation of the cloud, people have gained the ability to “pay as you go, pay as you grow”. Before this, you had to buy physical servers and so on, size to the end state, and pay for that upfront. But now with cloud and similar technology, one has the option of getting the resources one needs for that application, for that demand, and for a certain price. A clear example is the availability of software as a service on cloud. Back then, people had to buy software, which they can now rent.Another technology advancement is the popularity and availability of collaboration tools and software. Again, COVID-19 played a big role there. Everybody heard about Zoom and Microsoft teams very quickly.I believe digitalisation has driven quite a lot. These are the trends in technology. It has come to the point that without digitalisation, people can't really compete any longer. With the huge blow of a country’s economic crisis – along with the rupee’s depreciation and rising inflation – and with interest rates being so high, companies struggle to fund their working capital. Things like that, basically, are driving the need for efficiency.Today, if you are not efficient, because of the cost profile, you can't do things you did before. We can't use the processes we used before because we have to be much more efficient in this environment. During the country’s paper shortage problem, there was no way of issuing passports, ID cards, driving licenses, immigration forms, or electricity bills. Its impact today means that people are getting their water bills by SMS and paying them online. People are comfortable with it now. Again, it's more efficient as well. As a result of technological advancement, you need not wait in long queues anymore. How is Dialog Enterprise helping businesses of all sizes to embrace this digital transformation?First of all, we have a portfolio of solutions tailored to different sector segments at different price points. Through our knowledge and research, we kind of know what the demand is for these different communities, and we've come up with pre-done solutions that people can buy.Dialog has a lot of one-on-one tech talks on the LinkedIn websites, and so on, to educate people on available solutions.The next is that we are structured, as I mentioned, knowing that these requirements are very different. We are structured into serving large enterprises – whose demands and solutions are very different to the rest of the country, and similarly, small and medium enterprises, and so on. We are also structured into serving home-based businesses. There are a lot of businesses that are being run by a family, perhaps, such as where both husband and wife are lawyers running a small business from home. Then we have also come up with a self-service portal called “enterprise marketplace”. If you go to the enterprise marketplace, you will find different solution widgets that you can use yourself,  such as for SMS campaigns and know-your-customer (KYC) programmes; there are separate widgets for each. Dialog itself has gone through a digitalisation journey in the last five to six years, such as electronic reloads, and so on. Therefore, we are rich in experience. Moreover, I would say we've made a lot of mistakes ourselves, because you can't do digitalisation without making mistakes. What are some of the challenges that businesses face in their digital transformation journey?I think, from our experience, the first one is the ability to change. This is the first challenge because a lot of people digitalise their current processes, but that's not the way to do it. They must look at their current processes and see how they can eliminate them; then they could digitalise. First they have to take a white sheet of paper and design what they would like to digitalise. The first challenge is understanding and clear leadership.People need to spend on applications, hardware, and connectivity. So you need to be able to do that, but the lucky thing – or the good thing – is that it is now available as a “pay as you grow, pay as you go” model, like I said. One need not spend the entire amount upfront, so you can also test run certain things. I would say the people factor is the main thing to look at when you're on digitalisation. How is Dialog Enterprise addressing these challenges?The first thing that I talked about was bringing our knowledge of digitalisation to our customers. We have gone through five to six years of digitalisation processes and made a lot of mistakes along the way, and at the same time, a lot of victories and a lot of savings as well. We are also a part of the Axiata group which provides enterprise solutions in a number of countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and so on. Being a part of the Axiata  group, we have access to different solutions that can bring those best practices to our customers from the Axiata group experience, and then also our vendors and partners.What are some of the success stories of businesses that have partnered with Dialog Enterprise on their digital transformation journey?There is a lot of demand for digital transformation in logistics and in tracking asset management, and we've helped a lot of companies by addressing their issues. Currently, because of high fuel costs, a logistics company that owns a fleet of vehicles needs to know that its vehicles are going on optimised routes. Warehouse managing is another sector we have helped in. Some of these products have to be kept at a certain temperature, otherwise the efficacy will be gone. We've helped multiple companies, and also supermarkets, to manage that kind of situation – because now that fuel and power are expensive, they have to run their freezers, fridges, and air conditioning efficiently. The companies can save a lot of energy by using sensors on the dashboards to monitor them.The apparel industry is, too, involved in the digitalisation process. Most of our large apparel companies have factories in Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Africa – Egypt for instance – where they need to actually run their production and manage it centrally. We provide a solution that provides more connectivity across countries for their production planning. SMEs today need the ability to converge communications with a small call centre and a product description. Our coverage communication solutions help them set up their call solutions very quickly.In cyber security, we provide a lot of firewall solutions, end device management, and so on.What are Dialog Enterprise's plans for the future in terms of helping businesses in Sri Lanka to digitally transform?From a technology perspective, the future, I believe – what we are now looking at from the point of view of progression – is obviously 5G and all the benefits that 5G would bring, such as the ability to have millions of devices connected to the network.We are also looking at how we can be more relevant to the SME sector. They are struggling due to the dual impact of COVID-19 and our economic situation. We are seeing how we can build different product types, and bring down costs and prices, while challenging ourselves.Currently, digital transformation has become a must. If not, their competitiveness will be attacked, since a digitalised enterprise can be faster, cheaper, and able to scale up. Moreover, Sri Lankans are very good at adopting technology. Be they farmers, teachers, or whoever else, they will adapt to technology very quickly. Some of the global companies look at Sri Lanka for proof of their concepts, since we are a nation which adopts technology very fast. What advice would you give to businesses that are considering embarking on a digital transformation journey?I believe it's good to look at your business completely anew. First, businesses should focus on what is really needed and what they need to eliminate in their businesses. Then, they should not forget, it's a journey of trial and error. You can trial certain processes and see how it works. As I talked about, connectivity, cloud – all of those are there to help you experiment. So, I think those are the key things that you would need to do.Photos Krishan Kariyawasam
